    "Description": "Consider the following code:\n$objWorkSheetNew->getStyle(\"A1\")->getNumberFormat()->setFormatCode(PHPExcel_Style_NumberFormat::FORMAT_TEXT);\n$objWorkSheetNew->getCell(\"A1\")->setValue('000002');\nI expect that to display as \"000002\". However, it gets displayed as \"2\". The reason is that the cell contains a value of \"2\" and not of \"000002\".\nI can use $objWorkSheetNew->getStyle(\"A1\")->getNumberFormat()->setFormatCode('000000') to force padding on this value, but that's not the same. The value still remains as \"2\", it just displays as \"000002\".\nI'm originally using a variable there, of course. So I tried casting that to a string, but the problem remains. So, it seems that setValue always changes that \"stringy number\" to a number and there is no way to reverse it.\nÂ \nWhat I expect is that if I setValue('000002') this should be inserted as such and not converted to a number without leading zeros.\nAlso, concerning setFormatCode('000000') I find that if I select Format Cell in Excel it shows a Format of Special with locale Chinese(PRC). Which looks weird, if not wrong. I think it should rather be Custom '000000'.",
