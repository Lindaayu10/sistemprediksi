    "Description": "I've checked the the code for the INDIRECT() function in PHPExcel, and it's only designed to work with cell references, not with named ranges: the values that you are passing through to INDIRECT() in these cases are Named Ranges. I'm working out the changes necessary in the code to handle a named range.",
