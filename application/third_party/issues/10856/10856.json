    "Description": "Hi,\n \nIf we generate a Excel5 document and open it in Excel 2007 and select to insert a header/footer the text you're entering is not shown. It does however show after you click away to confirm the change and on print preview. The same file, a blank document in this case, when written as Excel 2007 works perfectly.\n \nSample PHP code is:\n \n    $objPHPExcel = new PHPExcel();\n    $objPHPExcel->setActiveSheetIndex(0);\n    $objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel5');\n    $objWriter->save( 'Excel5.xls' );\n \n    $objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel2007');\n    $objWriter->save( 'Excel2007.xlsx' );\n \nWe're saving all documents in Excel5 format for compatibility with older software on client systems but those with newer versions are encountering this issue.\n \nAlistair",

      "Message": "Problem verified.\r\n\r\nWhat is happening is that the header's default font color is white when you open Excel5.xls in MS Office Excel 2007. After looking at this in closer detail I think it is really a bug in the built-in converter in MS Office Excel 2007 where it doesn't deal correctly with the custom palette.\r\n\r\nTo provide a quick fix we can change Excel5 writer to increase likelihood of \"black\" being index 8 and \"white\" being index 9 in the custom palette. This fix should cover nearly all cases.\r\n\r\nWill set this as \"fixed\" although the fix is not perfect (it only works when default workbook style is black on white). Perfect fix will come with this work item:\r\nhttp://phpexcel.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=10409",
