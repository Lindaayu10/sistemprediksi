Exporting to the PHPExcel_Wrtier_PDF is now creating an error:\n\n> PHPExcel_Writer_Exception [ 0 ]: PDF Rendering library has not been defined.\n\nHere is the code:\n```\n$objWriter = new PHPExcel_Writer_PDF($objPHPExcel, 'PDF');\n$objWriter->save('php://output');\n```\n\nWriting to an excel file works fine:\n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel5');\n\nAnd there is no issue in when using PHPExcel 1.7.4.",
