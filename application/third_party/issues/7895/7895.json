    "Description": "Many formulas cannot be written to a spreadsheet using PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5. Several operators/operands are not recognized by the formula parser used for generating xls spreadsheets (Excel 97 - Excel 2003). For some formulas an exception is thrown and the xls file will not be created; for other formulas the xls file is saved, but some part of the formula is missing.\n \nWhat does not seem to work in formulas:\n \n- Unary plus: (example =+A1)\n- Percent: (=100%)\n- Power: (=2^8)\n- Concatenation operator (=\"Hello\"&\"World\")\n- Intersection operator (=A2 A2)\n- Range list operator (=A1,A2)\n- Omitted argument in function (=SUM(1,,3))\n- String constant containing double quotation mark (=\"buy \"\"fresh\"\" fish\")\n- Error constant (=#VALUE!)\n- Boolean constant (=TRUE)\n- Array constant (={1,2,3})\n- Defined names (=foo)\n- Cell range address with absolute references (=SUM($A$1:$A$3))\n- Sheet name containing single quotation mark (='Buy ''fresh'' fish':A1)\n- 3d reference involving sheet range (=SUM(Sheet1:Sheet2!A1))\n- 3d area involving sheet range (=SUM(Sheet1:Sheet2!A1:B2))\n- Whitespace in formulas (carriage returns as well as spaces)\n \nPHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 is based on the PEAR Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer, so one may run into similar problems with that package. It seems that not much of the above has been reported for PEAR Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer, but there is a bug report for the concatenation operator:\nhttp://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=2405\n \nJudging from the documentation, the CPAN Spreadsheet-WriteExcel by John McNamara (Perl module still maintained) (which the PEAR Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer was originally ported from) does a much better job, but even for that module not all of the above has been resolved.\nhttp://search.cpan.org/dist/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel/\n \nNot sure at the moment what it takes to fix these problems.",
