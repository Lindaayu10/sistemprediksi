    "Description": "COUNT() method in Functions.php is not initialising $returnValue correctly.\nIt is being re-initialised to $aArgs[0] after $aArgs = PHPExcel_Calculation_Functions::flattenArray(func_get_args())\nwhen it should simply be initialised to 0 as it is in the first line of the function.\nÂ \nAttached file includes the fix, plus functions for AVERAGE and MEDIAN\nNote that these latter new functions need updating in the $this->_functionMappings array in Calculation.php as well.",
