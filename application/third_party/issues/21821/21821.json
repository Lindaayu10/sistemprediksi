    "Description": "I have an input file/template Excel2007  file which has a few formulas and has a lot of styles ( text color, cell color, etc). I am able to open the file and make few modifications and but saving it gives me an error.\n\nWhen it does not error out, it writes a really large file (input is 1 MB and output is 9 MB) with no changes whatsoever. All I am doing it opening it and closing it. And I am unable to read the file that was written.\n\n```\ncode snippet-- nothing fancy!\n\n               $objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel2007');\n\t\t$objPHPExcel = $objReader->load($inputFile);\n\n\n               $objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel2007');\n\t       $objWriter -> setPreCalculateFormulas(false);\n\t     $outputFile = '/tmp/test.xlsx';\n\t     $objWriter -> save($outputFile);\n```\n__Added: __ I just noticed these errors occurring sporadically\nFatal error: Maximum execution time of 300 seconds exceeded in /var/www/html/application/third_party/PHPExcel/Shared/XMLWriter.php on line 102\n\nFatal error: Maximum execution time of 300 seconds exceeded in /var/www/html/application/third_party/PHPExcel/Writer/Excel2007/Worksheet.php on line 502\n\nI will not be able to share the input file but I can safely say there is no error in that. I was able to change one attribute and save the file and read it a month ago. Now I am back to the project and this confuses me. \n\n\n\nAny pointers would be of great help please!!\n\n\nThank you,\nlavsubbu",
