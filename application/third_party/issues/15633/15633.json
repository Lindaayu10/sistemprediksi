    "Description": "I am loading an xlsx template that was prepared with Excel 2007. Some of the sheets contain local named ranges. Depending on the data I want to output, I am deleting some sheets from the template. When I output the PHPExcel data into an xlsx file again, this resulting file leads to error messages when read by Excel 2007. Inspecting the xl/workbook.xml file contained within the xlsx archive, i find entries in the form of\n<definedNames>\n<definedName name=\"BookingRowSumColumn\" localSheetId=\"\">'PLANNED'!$L$1</definedName> ...\n \nSo the names for the deleted sheet (here: the \"BookingRowSumColumn\" name on the \"PLANNED\" sheet) are still being output, albeit with an empty localSheetId.\n \nI can work around this by looping through the named ranges in the workbook and deleting the ones pertaining to the sheet I intend to delete, and delete the sheet afterwards. The expected behaviour is that the deletion of a sheet, by name or by id, should also completely delete all related named ranges.",
