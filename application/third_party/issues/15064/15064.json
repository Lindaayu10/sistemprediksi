    "Description": "When reading an Excel 2007 with a fill color, it is read in and saved as black (0), even if right-clicked on the cell and set the fill color that way. \n \nThis problem can be demonstrated with the following code, using PHPExcel 1.7.5. Version 1.7.4 did the same thing. No matter how I try to set the fill color, it always disappears.\n \n<?php\n//Simply open a file and write it to the browser\nrequire_once(\"PHPExcel/Classes/PHPExcel.php\");\n$reader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader(\"Excel2007\");\n$workbook = $reader->load(\"FillTest.xlsx\");\n \nheader('Content-Type: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet');\nheader('Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=\"FillTest.xlsx\"');\nheader('Cache-Control: max-age=0');\n \n$writer = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($workbook, \"Excel2007\");\n$writer->save(\"php://output\");\n?>",
