      "Message": "There is no logical reason why getHighestRow() should return a lower row number than that containing the last content in the worksheet; typically people complain about the converse, because it returns the highest row number that contains anything, whether style settings or images or merges or print settings or named ranges or whatever, even if it doesn't contain any actual data",
