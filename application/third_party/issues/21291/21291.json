    "Description": "Hi,\n\nI compared PHPExcel's CHIDIST output with that of other online applications and PHP code:\n\n1. http://www.danielsoper.com/statcalc3/calc.aspx?id=11\n2. http://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/PValue1.cfm\n3. PHP code I happened to find to compute the P-Value using the Critical Value and the degrees of Freedom (same parameters CHIDIST uses): http://statistical-research.com/chi-square-distribution-php/\n\nOf the three trials below, the first two showed that CHIDIST returned the same output as the other applications. However, the third did not match.\n\n\nCHIDIST(14.07,7) - OK\nreturned 0.049950250317483\nother application returned a very close approximation\n\nCHIDIST(25.989,18) - OK\nreturned 0.10000969393677\nother application returned a very close approximation\n\nCHIDIST(65,2) - Not OK\nreturned 0.41928893851469\nother application returned a number less than 0.001 (after implementing the PHP code I encountered, it returned 5.6040616591702E-11\n\nIs there an error in PHPExcel's CHIDIST in some cases?",
