    "Description": "Im writing an excel file based on a template that has two sheets. Before writing the file I delete the second sheet. The PHPExcel class throws a notice saying invalid index 1 during write. It seems that it was trying to write 2nd sheet when its already been deleted.\n \nProposed fix: change active sheet to next available when current active sheet has been deleted\n \nWorkaround: After calling removeSheetByIndex(), call setActiveSheetIndex() to manually change active sheet that exists\n \nThanks!\n:)",
