    "Description": "When you insert a new row or column the formulas that gets updated are only the ones in the current worksheet.\nÂ \nI'm working on the relevant part of the code and see if I can produce a patch, but I was curious if maybe I'm doing something wrong. Either way, I'll include some code later, maybe you can use it in case such functionality doesn't exist yet.",
