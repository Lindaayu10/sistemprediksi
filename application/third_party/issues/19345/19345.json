    "Description": "When save()ing a fairly complex Excel file read from a template (which I cannot post, sorry) I see hundreds of errors logged like this:\n\n\"PHP Notice:  Uninitialized string offset: 0\" \n\nWith the error source of Calculation/Functions.php line 311.\n\nThis turns out to be inside the _ifCondition function where the code\n\n\t\t$condition\t= PHPExcel_Calculation_Functions::flattenSingleValue($condition);\n\t\tif (!in_array($condition{0},array('>', '<', '='))) {\n\t\t\tif (!is_numeric($condition)) { $condition = PHPExcel_Calculation::_wrapResult(strtoupper($condition)); }\n\t\t\treturn '='.$condition;\n\t\t}\n               // ... etc, rest of function follows\n\nIs executed. The first line is 310.\n\nApparently what's happening is that flattenSingleValue() is returning an empty string.\n\nOkay, so, no problem! I can check for and handle this case. But, what is the appropriate return value for this function when this $condition is empty? Is it an empty string? Is is '='? The former seems to not cause a corrupted resultant file, but I don't know if that means it's correct.\n\nThis is with PHPExcel 1.7.8. I am reading from Excel5 and writing to Excel2007 (if that helps); this occurs on (at least) 64bit Windows.",
