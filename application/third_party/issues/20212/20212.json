    "Description": "I am working with a large database and querying it to fetch data and generating around 1000 excel files with an average of 100 rows per file. Each Excel file is heavily formatted(mergeing cells. horiz align,verti align.borders,various page setup properties,cell height,coloumn width,etc). I am not using any colours or graphs. Initially there was  a time limit & memory usage problem and so i used the below statements to fix it.\n\nset_time_limit(10000);\nini_set('memory_limit', '-1');\n\nNow the the size of the data base has doubled and when i execute my program, before timeout occurs, Google Chrome gives me the following message \" This webpage is not available\"( mesage comes after executing for about 7-8 mins). The thing is that it is generating some excel files for the 7-8 mins correctly but not completing the whole process.\n\nPlease help me.\nThanks in advance.",
