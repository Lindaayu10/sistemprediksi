    "Description": "Excel Reader 2007 problem with \"shared\" formulae when master is an error\n \nThe Excel 2007 reader identifies shared formulae and stores details of the first (master) formula in an array ($sharedFormulas). Subsequent references to this shared formula have a formula value of an empty string, and the value read from the $sharedFormulas array is used to populate the actual formula for these cells.\nWhen the calculation of this formula returns a valid result, this is not a problem.\nHowever, if the calculated value of the first (master) is an error, so $cellDataType is 'e', then the formula is not written to the $sharedFormulas array. Only when the first _valid_ (non-erroneous) result of a shared formula is encountered is it written to the $sharedFormulas array, but the formula value in this case is an empty string, because this cell isn't the _real_ master.\n \nThis can be fixed by commenting out the special logic for erroneous cells between lines 592 and 600 of the Excel2007.php reader; and this fix appears to work. However, I don't know if this simple solution is likely to have any side effects.",
