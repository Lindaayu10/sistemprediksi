    "Description": "The original spreadsheet_excel_writer from the PEAR library uses not even half as much memory as phpExcel.\nThis results from the fact that it does continues writing. \nThis suggestion is to support this mode in phpExcel. \nIt would mean that already written out cells cannot be changed anymore (because the whole Spreadsheet is NOT kept in memory, just the current line). It would serve well for most people that just need phpExcel for data export, not for real Spreadsheet Usage. \n \nImplement it as optional writer, after a cell is written out, any modifications to 'earlier' cells ar just ignored.\n \nI am read to do a big donation if the gets implemented.",
