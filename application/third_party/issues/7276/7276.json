    "Description": "Posted by GeoffreyB (http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=33214):\n \nHi all,\n \nI am having troubles when I am trying to run my code using this library on my production server (a shared server where I have minimal to no control). The server has a open_basedir configuration that does not allow access to the system's /tmp directory.\n \nI found the PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5->setTempDir() method and assumed that this would fix the issue however I still get the following warnings and error;\n \n \nWarning: tmpfile() [function.tmpfile]: open_basedir restriction in effect. File(/tmp) is not within the allowed path(s) in /home/lo/log/logss.com.au/public/www/site/administrator/components/com_assess/lib/PHPExcel/Writer/Excel5/Worksheet.php on line 477\n \nWarning: tmpfile() [function.tmpfile]: open_basedir restriction in effect.
