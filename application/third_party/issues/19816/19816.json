      "Message": "I can see changing a call to getCellByColumnAndRow() being faster if the cell doesn't exist; but if the cell does exist then getCell() should be faster; but I'll run some tests to see what affect it has when handling loads, saves and some general updating.\r\n\r\nNote that PHPExcel is about to undergo a pretty major rewrite for version 2.0, meaning that there won't be any more releases of the 1.x branch, other than limited patch releases.\r\n\r\nIt also means that I'll be looking closely at every single method in every single class, looking at how they can be refactored, and simplified... once I've \"namespaced\" the develop_2.0.0 branch, feel free to help out with suggestions, code reviews and even pull requests on github.",
