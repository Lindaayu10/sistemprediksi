    "Description": "I'm using PHPExcel to generate product spreadsheet - each row has product details and 1 image.\n \nAll works fine.  But sometimes I want to pare this sheet down - cull out a couple rows and upload just those changes.  Unfortunately... when I delete rows in my PHPExcel generated spreadsheet, the images don't delete.  \n \nThis is an issue when I try to upload a couple of rows to server for processing -- hundreds of images are getting carried along w/ spreadsheet and causing real performance issues.\n \nHow do I write the initial spreadsheet so the images delete when the rows are deleted?",
