    "Description": "Hello,\n\nI'm trying to generate an excel file and almost everything works fine but i'm having trouble with 2 features.\nI've found the method showRowColHeaders() but i'd like something like printRowColHeaders() to force it in my printing options when i generate the file. I can't find any method to do that.\n\nI'm also having some problems with the method setAlignWithMargins(). It works fine for Excel2007 but it doesn't work at all for Excel5 ? Is this method only available for Excel2007 ?\n\nThanks in advance :)",
