      "Message": "The package is listed on packagist.org because I've been pressured to make it available there... in fact, several others have also made it available via packagist before ever I did. The reference to psr0 in autoloader allows PHPExcel's autoloader to work with other psr0 compliant autoloader packages (as far as I'm aware, I'm not a composer or packagist expert). I'm told that it works; and that's all I really know about composer and packagist.\r\n\r\nOther files that aren't psr0 compliant include the PDF and CSV Writers, those files fail on case sensitivity in the filename (according to PHPCS with the psr0 sniff set)... and the whole library cannot be psr0 compliant because it isn't namespaced (one of the drawbacks of maintaining PHP 5.2 backward compatibility).\r\n\r\nThe newest version of PHPExcel (version 2, currently under development) is being designed to be psr2 compliant, requires a minimum PHP version of 5.3 so that it can use namespaces (as well as other PHP 5.3 features such as closures and late static binding), and will not be backward compatible with the version 1.x branch.",
