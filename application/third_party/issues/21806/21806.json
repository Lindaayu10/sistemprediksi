The cells are blank.\n\nI opened the file in Excel and then-resaved the file and re-sent it to the iPad.\n\nThis file rendered accurately.\n\nI unzipped both files on the desktop and attempted a comparison between the contents.\n\nI did find some differences between the way the RichText object was being handled.\n\nIf I created a simple file demonstrating this issue would anybody here have a look at it?\n\nI would love to fix it myself if I could to help everybody out. I would have to study the Office Format specification and try and see if there were any issues with the implementation. Or I could try and reverse engineer it well enough to suit my purposes but I wouldn't want to pollute the code base with my changes in that case.\n\nFor the time being I have re-written the document format to not require the RichText object.\n\nKim Groves",
