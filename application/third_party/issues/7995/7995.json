    "Description": "When one produces workbooks with multiple sheets using PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007 then all the sheets are always \"selected\" in the final workbook. Note that \"selected sheet\" is not the same as \"active sheet\". To select sheets in Excel one would use CTRL+click and the selected sheet tabs get a slightly different shade.\n \nThis is somewhat unexpected behavior and may also give problems as it is not so easy to see in MS Office Excel that the sheets are selected. For example, if one opens the workbook and just starts to type cell values then these values are inserted across all the sheets.\n \nTest (plain read/write, 3 sheets):\n----\n$reader = new PHPExcel_Reader_Excel2007();\n$excel = $reader->load('read.xlsx');\n \n$writer = new PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007($excel);\n$writer->save('write.xlsx');\n \nExpected result:\n----\nOnly first sheet is selected in output\n \nActual result:\n----\nAll sheets are selected in output (compare sheet tab shade)\n \nEnvironment:\n----\nPHPExcel: Latest source from SVN (1.6.4+)",
