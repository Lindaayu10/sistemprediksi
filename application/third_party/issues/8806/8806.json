    "Description": "I have noticed that users are having many of the same problems when redirecting output to a client's browser. I think we can avoid many bug reports if we update the documentation a bit.\n \nI suggest that we replace this part in the documentation:\n \n-----\nHTTP headers\n \nSome example headers that can be used to force a download can be found below. Make sure to replace filename with the filename you want to output.\n \nheader(\"Pragma: public\");\nheader(\"Expires: 0\");\nheader(\"Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0\"); \nheader(\"Content-Type: application/force-download\");\nheader(\"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\");\nheader(\"Content-Type: application/download\");\nheader(\"Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=filename\"); \nheader(\"Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary \");\n------\n \n \nwith the following one:\n \n----\nHTTP headers\n \nExample of a script redirecting an Excel 2007 file to the client's browser:\n \n<?php\n/* Here there will be some code where you create $objPHPExcel */\n \n// redirect output to client browser\nheader('Content-Type: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet');\nheader('Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=\"myfile.xlsx\"');\nheader('Cache-Control: max-age=0');\n \n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel2007');\n$objWriter->save('php://output'); \n?>\n \nExample of a script redirecting a BIFF8 Excel file to the client's browser:\n \n<?php\n/* Here there will be some code where you create $objPHPExcel */\n \n// redirect output to client browser\nheader('Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel');\nheader('Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=\"myfile.xls\"');\nheader('Cache-Control: max-age=0');\n \n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel5');\n$objWriter->save('php://output'); \n?>\n \nCaution:\n* Make sure not to include any echo statements or output any other contents than the Excel file. There should be no whitespace before the opening <?php tag and at most one line break after the closing ?> tag (which can also be omitted to avoid problems).\n \n* Make sure that your script is saved without a BOM (Byte-order mark). (Because this counts as echoing output)\n \n* Same things apply to all included files\n \nFailing to follow the above guidelines may result in corrupt Excel files arriving at the client browser, and/or that headers cannot be set by PHP (resulting in warning messages).\n \n------\nend of suggestion\n \nThe headers above are the headers that have always worked for me. The 'Cache-Control: max-age=0' is what works in Internet Explorer for preventing caching. If one tries with other variants of Cache-Control statements, one finds that the suggested filename is ignored by Internet Explorer (at least IE6, but also IE7 if I recall correctly).",
