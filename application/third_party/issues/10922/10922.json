      "Message": "The problem has to do with hash indexes which were introduced in PHPExcel 1.6.7 to speed up the writers. That was a good solution at the time when we didn't have automatic style sharing.\r\n\r\nSince PHPExcel 1.7.0 the writers no longer use the hash index, but we are still setting the hash index when the hash tables are built. Between two saves the workbook may have changed but the hash indexes are not reset which gives rise to the bug.\r\n\r\nHow about if we drop the concept of hash indexes? I will double check the classes to see if this is possible.\r\n",
