    "Description": "Hi\n\nI am trying to create/download an xlsx file (Excel2007). This works perfectly on my (windows) development stack, either with native zip or with PCLZip.\n\nMoving the code to the production server (solaris, running xampp) results in \"zipArchive not found\" type errors, so I switched to using PCLZip, but this produces segfaults as below.\n\n[Thu May 14 10:00:08 2015] [notice] child pid 16206 exit signal Segmentation fault (11), possible coredump in /opt/xampp\n\nThis is also true of attempting to use the example files.\n\nPHP reports zip enabled on both dev and prod. All files are accessible and in the expected places. I don't know what else to look for or do. \n\nDev stack is using PHP 5.4.24, Apache/2.4.7 (Win32) \nProd stack is using PHP 5.3.8, Apache/2.2.21 (Unix)\n\nSuggestions?",
