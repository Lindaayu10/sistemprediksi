      "Message": "Formula element \"f\" - si (Shared Group Index)\r\n\r\nOptional attribute to optimize load performance by sharing formulas.\r\nWhen a formula is a shared formula (t value is shared) then this value indicates the\r\ngroup to which this particular cell's formula belongs. The first formula in a group of\r\nshared formulas is saved in the f element. This is considered the 'master' formula cell.\r\nSubsequent cells sharing this formula need not have the formula written in their f\r\nelement. Instead, the attribute si value for a particular cell is used to figure what the\r\nformula expression should be based on the cell's relative location to the master formula\r\ncell.\r\n\r\nA cell is shared only when si is used and t is shared. The formula expression for a cell\r\nthat is specified to be part of a shared formula (and is not the master) shall be ignored,\r\nand the master formula shall override.\r\n\r\nIf a master cell of a shared formula range specifies that a particular cell is part of the\r\nshared formula range, and that particular cell does not use the si and t attributes to\r\nindicate that it is shared, then the particular cell's formula shall override the shared\r\nmaster formula. If this cell occurs in the middle of a range of shared formula cells, the\r\nearlier and later formulas shall continue sharing the master formula, and the cell in\r\nquestion shall not share the formula of the master cell formula.\r\n\r\nLoading and handling of a cell and formula using an si attribute and whose t value is\r\nshared, located outside the range specified in the master cell associated with the si\r\ngroup, is implementation defined.\r\n\r\nMaster cell references on the same sheet shall not overlap with each other.",
