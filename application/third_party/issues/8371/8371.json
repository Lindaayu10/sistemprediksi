    "Description": "Questions:\n1. Is this needed?\n2. Is this possible?\n3. Functionality?\n \nSome thoughts:\n1. MS Office Excel has the ability to read HTML pages and import not just tables, but also text, images, formatting, hyperlinks etc.\n \nIf similar functionality is ported to PHPExcel it would be possible to do something like this:\n \nCreate automated script which on a regular basis can extract prices for you from pages with known HTML structure, publish in Excel format, and perhaps notify you if some price has dropped.\n \n2. Not sure what tools are are available within PHP for this.\n \n3. PHPExcel_Reader_HTML would probably not be so useful unless you include a bunch of options how the read should take place. For example, you may want the option to read only from a specific <table> element.\n \nAny thougths?",

      "Message": "I don't think this would be too hard but could be useful to some people. The only problem is defining the requirements, it's a bit fuzzy because there's no real way to tell what's data and what isn't.\r\n\r\nAnyway, for implementation, you could use PHP's DOM class. It has heaps of utilities to read HTML files:\r\nhttp://au2.php.net/manual/en/domdocument.loadhtml.php\r\nhttp://au2.php.net/manual/en/domdocument.loadhtmlfile.php\r\n\r\nXPath could also be useful:\r\nhttp://au2.php.net/manual/en/class.domxpath.php",

Really interested in how this could be created.",

      "Message": "Colleagues, thank you for your useful tips and comments. I will have to check out the resources you are providing and see what comes out of it.\r\n\r\nI am aware that it would be impossible to convert from HTML to PHPExcel and back again to HTML without any loss. Mapping from HTML to PHPExcel is lossy.\r\n\r\nThere have been situations where I needed to import <table> elements and extract prices. Some companies needed to auto-monitor price information for hundreds of products from competitors which were only published as HTML on web sites. These prices could suddenly change, and they would need to react quickly. At this point, it would have been very convenient if I could have grabbed the HTML page and targeted cell values using familiar grid structure interface from PHPExcel such as getCell('A1')->getValue().\r\n\r\nYou are right, it may or may not be useful for others and it may be out of the scope for PHPExcel... I have really no idea. As you say, it is also hard to define the requirements.\r\n\r\nThink I will evaluate the problem again at a later stage next time I need this and post a discussion with some code for evaluation. You gave me some good ideas. Thanks again, both of you. Closing for now.",
