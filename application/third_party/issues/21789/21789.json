    "Description": "Hello!\n\nI generate an excel sheet. There is only one sheet with couple columns and less than 100 rows.\nI made a header row than I insert values row by row with setCellValueByColumnAndRow().\n\nOne of columns has a \"description\" content which include equal sign..as a text...\nIf I do not make any protection I got an error message:\n_Worksheet!C504 -> Formula Error: Unexpected operator '='_\n\nSo I protect equal sign with a backslash and my code is work fine, excel sheet has been generated as right,\nbut! the backslash is seen in the text before the equal sign.\n\n__The question is:__ how I can protect the equal sign to be able to generate excel sheet and in the textt will be only the equal sign without any protection character.\n\nThanks",
