    "Description": "This may be seen as a preparation work item for work item 8916: Support for Rich-Text in PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5.\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=8916\n \nWe carry out various simplifications in PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5_Workbook for writing the shared strings table. This should also improve readability of the code.\n \nBasically, the PEAR Spreadsheet_Writer_Excel methods _calculateSharedStringsSizes() and _storeSharedStringsTable() are combined into one method writeSharedStringsTable(), while taking into account already implemented Miso-patch from PEAR bug #1572\nhttp://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=1572\n \nFurthermore, we make some cosmetic changes, so we use the full allowed size of BIFF8 record data blocks, 8224 + 4 bytes. Previously, SST record data would be a bit shorter than allowed, and the following CONTINUE records, even shorter.",
