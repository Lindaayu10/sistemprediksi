    "Description": "Hello, I'm new here and so apologize if this is not the right place to put a request.\n\nWould it be possible to add methods to set the initial window size (and perhaps position too) for new documents?\n\nContrary to some posts I've found online that state Excel saves this data locally per user, I have noticed that it stores this information in the Excel file itself. To test this I created a new document using Mac Excel 2011, changed the size and position, then opened it on a different Mac using Excel 2004 and it retained the previously saved window size and position.\n\nI'm hoping that there might be a way to set this as documents created by PHPExcel always open very small, about 7 columns by 16 rows (assuming standard cell sizes). Or any suggestions for a way around this would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you.",
