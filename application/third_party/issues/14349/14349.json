    "Description": "Hi again.\n \nI try to gererate a multi-sheet xlsx file. When using formula =LOOKUP(S5;am_Courses_school_type!$B$4:$B$999;am_Courses_school_type!$A$4:$A$999) PHPExcel does not result with save at all, but everytime crashes in different places. I have discovered that it occurs in Calculation.php::_processTokenStack(). Sometimes, on processing binary operator, and sometimes, on processing function call.\n \nIf I remove formulas - excel file is well generated.\n \nHosting server PHP version is 5.2.5\n \nPS: Locally with PHP 5.3.1 everything works.",

So, there was a situation, when a cell was referencing another empty cell in empty sheet. For some reason, those formulas were calculated which resulted in a crash.\r\n\r\nGenerating sheets in \"right\" order and referencing only existing cells eliminated the problem.\r\n\r\nBut, is it right behaviour - to crash in those situations?",
