    "Description": "With Excel2007 Reader instance, it fails to load Apache POI generated Excel\n \nAttached is an Apache POI created Excel file. Ran unit test to verify it could be formatted by PHPExcel, and throws an Exception with this message during load by Excel Reader:\n'Invalid argument supplied for foreach()'\n \nWith Microsoft Office Excel 2007, Opened and Saved same Apache POI created Excel file, and then ran again this file and Excel Reader was able to load without error.\n \n      // Create new PHPExcel reader object\n      $objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel2007');\n      // Load PHPExcel from file\n      self::$objPHPExcel = $objReader->load($fromFileName);\n \nUsing OpenXmlSdkTool.exe, its Compare utility:\nThe difference shows that the Saved version of ApachePOI Excel file shows additional tags: /xl/calcChain.xml and /xl/theme/theme1.xml\n \nAttached within ZIP file are the Before and After Saved Apache POI generated Excels.\n \nJeff in Seattle",
