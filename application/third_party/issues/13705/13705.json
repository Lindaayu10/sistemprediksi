    "Description": "Let's say we have a workbook in an .xls(x) file we read with a reader. \nThere are two sheets in it: 'First Sheet' and 'Second Sheet'. The second sheet has a reference to the first like \"='First Sheet'!A1\". \nIf we delete first sheet in PHPExcel and then try to save, we will get Fatal error:  Call to a member function cellExists() on a non-object in /.../PHPExcel/Calculation.php on line 3094, because $pCellParent->getParent()->getSheetByName($matches[2]) will return non-object. \nÂ \nI think this shouldn't cause Fatal error, but rather just an empty cell or something like this.",
