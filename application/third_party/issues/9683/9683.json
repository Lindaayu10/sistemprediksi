    "Description": "From thread:\nhttp://phpexcel.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=52271\n \nMS Office Excel is apparently able to read an Excel file even if it is defect and CODEPAGE record is located in worksheet stream instead of workbook stream. But PHPExcel_Reader_Excel5 can not. Sample file attached generated by 3rd-party application.\n \nTo mimic behavior of MS Office Excel, in this work item we change the behavior of Excel5 reader so CODEPAGE record defaults to CP1252 when missing.",
