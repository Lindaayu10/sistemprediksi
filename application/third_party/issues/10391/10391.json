    "Description": "Hello,\nUsually people only save one file per script, but if you save multiple Excel files in a same script, you lose your style. Because \"$_defaultStyle\" from class \"PHPExcel_Style\" is static and the constructor defined it by using his own instance.\n \nIf you need to fix this bug, change the visibily of \"$_defaultStyle\" from private to static:\nfile /PHPExcel/Style.php line 70:\n- private static $_defaultStyle;\n+ public static $_defaultStyle;\n \nthen, in your code, after writing an Excel file (or before creating a new one), use:\nPHPExcel_Style::$_defaultStyle = null;\n \nto reset style.\n \nIt's not the best solution, I know, but in an urgent way i have used that.\n \nEnjoy",

      "Message": "sunphp, I think you are right about this for PHPExcel 1.6.7.\r\n\r\nBut in the latest source code each workbook is assigned a separate style object for the default style. It is no longer a static class variable. Therefore you should not be seeing this issue with latest source code. Please try it.",

When I created the new document some of my styles from the previous document is still visible if I do not over write the cell with new data, to be more specific I have only noticed this with borders.",
