    "Description": "As we know, with PHPExcel, it is easy to add images when you have a filename:\n \n$drawing = new PHPExcel_Worksheet_Drawing();\n$drawing->setPath($filename);\n \nBut for dynamically created images you may want to add the image from memory:\n \n$image = imagecreatetruecolor(...);\n... // image manipulation\n$drawing->setPath($image);\n \nIs there any chance for having such an option? One could decide that the result of the above operation results in PNG image with autogenerated (internal) filename.\n \nCurrently, the workaround is to save the image resource as a temporary file first and then add it the usual way. But this may not even be easy. Not only may there be read/write restrictions on the server. But when I tried using tempnam() it turned out that when the filename extension is missing for the image you get broken xlsx files.\n \nThe direct reason why I am asking is because I am running into the above trouble when trying to implement Excel5 reader image support.",

      "Message": "As I think about it, it may instead be best to have it so one can add images via string and not image resource. That would give you maximum flexibility because you can then decide image format yourself (png, jpeg). One can always convert from image resource to string like this:\r\n\r\n$image = imagecreatetruecolor(...);\r\n... // image manipulation\r\n$string = imagepng($image);",
