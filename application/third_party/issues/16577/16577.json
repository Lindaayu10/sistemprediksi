    "Description": "First of all, sorry for double posting this, but I posted this on a \"closed\" issue, so I was affraid of that not being read.\n \nI'm using PHPExcel 1.7.6 and CodeIgniter 1.7 and having to deal with this issue.\n \nI've tried both Excel5 and Excel2007 writers and got the same result.\n \nI'm not sure if this is the problem causing the \"file corrupt\" message, but opening the file in Notepad++, I was able to detect that at the very begining of the generated file there are two special characters, the tab and the newline character, in this exact order \"\\t\\n\". If I remove those characters, Excel opens the file flawlessly and without that creepy message.\n \nBTW... I'm using Windows 7 with Excel 2007 and tried on another pc with Windows 7 and Excel 2010.\n \nI've attached a file generated with Excel5 writer and having test data (just a bunch of strings repeated in every cell)",
