    "Description": "Apple's Numbers Spreadsheet application supports opening Office 97 files, and office 2007 files, however it can not open the xls, nor the xlsx file produced by PHPExcel.  For the xls, it claims the file is actually an office 95 file (which for some reason apple doesn't support).\n \n(this is using the sample documents on your website)",
