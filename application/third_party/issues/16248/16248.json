    "Description": "Hi,\n \nThe problem is that the file cannot be opened correctly. I am using Ubuntu 11.04 with LibreOffice.\n \nWhen I click on the downloaded file, LibreOffice would open up with an import option popup window. This means that the file downloaded is not fully recognized as an XLS file with the correct formatting or encoding. (See screenshots)\n \nHere are the things I already tried in solving the problem.\n1. Tried the PHPExcel if its working in its own DOWNLOAD OK\n2. Put PHPExcel folder to the root folder of a Codeigniter application, and directly access the files DOWNLOAD OK\n3. Integrated the PHPExcel as a library to the Codeigniter application OK\n4. Tried downloading a file using\n \n\t\t    header('Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel');\n\t    \t    header('Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=\"'.$filename.'\"');\n\t\t    header('Cache-Control: max-age=0');\n\t\t    $objWriter = IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel5');\n\t\t\t\n   \t\t    $objWriter->save('php://output');\n \n     FAILED - file is downloaded but can't be opened correctly\n \n5. Tried saving the file to the root folder of the application and opened it. OK!!!!!!  (screenshot-2.png)\n \n\t\t    $objWriter = IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel5');\t\t\t\n   \t\t    $objWriter->save('text.xls'); \n \nThe file is perfectly opened.\n \nI suspect that this is somehow a header issue, but i can't make it work out. I already encountered this problem before, but haven't documented the solution.",

Then just redirect to that file. Essentialy, this will download the file to the user's browser.",
