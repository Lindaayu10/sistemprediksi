    "Description": "As has been noted, PHPExcel_Reader_Excel5 does not yet have true formula support. Structure of formula is lost, only calculated value is preserved.\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=7388\n \nStill, even without true formula support, reading is problematic for boolean and error type formula results.\n \nProblem with booleans:\n-----\nFor boolean formula results, the cell value is read as follows. Example:\n \nvalue: string(4) \"TRUE\"\ndata type: PHPExcel_Cell_DataType::TYPE_STRING\n \nIt would have been better if reading had yielded the same result as for the corresponding plain boolean:\n \nvalue: bool(true)\ndata type: PHPExcel_Cell_DataType::TYPE_BOOL\n \n \nProblem with error types:\n-----\nFor error type formula results, the cell value is read as follows. Example:\n \nvalue: string(8) \"ERROR:42\"\ndata type: PHPExcel_Cell_DataType::TYPE_STRING\n \nIt would have been better if it had returned the same result as for the corresponding plain error which is this:\n \nvalue: string(4) \"#N/A\"\ndata type: PHPExcel_Cell_DataType::TYPE_STRING\n \nEnvironment:\n----\nPHPExcel: Latest source from SVN (1.6.3+)",
