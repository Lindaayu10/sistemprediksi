    "Description": "My system has to generate a xls file. The first sheet should contain links to the other sheets. I searched for means to do it and I found a code sample that pointed to something like this:\n \n $summarySheet->setValue('A5', 'Click here');\n $summarySheet->getCell('A5')->getHyperlink()->setUrl(\"Sheet 2!A1\")->setTooltip(\"Click here\");\n \nWhen I run the script and it writes the xls, everything is at the right place and working, except the links. Is that a bug? Or maybe I'm not using it correctly? Do you know how to solve that problem? What I need is a cell to point to another sheet, to make a summary.\n \nSince now, thank you for your attention. Any advice would be deeply appreciated.",
