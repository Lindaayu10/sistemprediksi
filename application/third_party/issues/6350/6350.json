    "Description": "This time I'll copy-paste the text in the description. It's an annoying bug of Codeplex that you can't hit enter on the description field.\n \nI'm still having some difficulties using the calculation cache. This time it's because of the cache expiration time. The last time you did an update on the Calculation class, you set the cache expiration time to 0.01 second. That's by far not enough for calculation of some bigger Excel documents.\n \nI'd like to see a function Calculation::setCacheExpirationTime() to set the expiration time during runtime. The former default of 2 seconds seems fine to use.\n \nI know this is not the place to do so, but I'd like to thank you for all the great work and fast development!",
