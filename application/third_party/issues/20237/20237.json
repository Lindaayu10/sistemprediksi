    "Description": "I have an example xlsx file written with writer/Excel2007.\nWith 1.7.8, style.xml has a cellXfs count of 6.\nThe same spreadsheet written with 1.7.9 has a style.xml where cellXfs count is 111. \n\nIn my example the cellXfs count went from 6 to 111, with many many duplicates. \nFor a large spreadsheet this leads to considerable bloat in the xlsx file.\n\nThe problem is in classes/PHPExcel/Style.php  at line 406\n\n    if ($workbook->cellXfExists($newStyle)) {  \n\nFunction cellXfExists never returns true.\nso all styles are added to the collection as if they were unique.\n\nAs a test, I restored line 406 to its 1.7.8 logic:\n\n    if ($existingStyle = $workbook->getCellXfByHashCode($newStyle->getHashCode())) { \n                       \nthat fixed the problem.",
