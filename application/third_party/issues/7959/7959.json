    "Description": "I have PHP excel 1.6.4.\nI create an xlsx file 'on the fly' (that means the user is prompted to download the xlsx file immediately instead of saving it in the disk).\nWhen I import with the require_once command a required class in order to query database and collect data the xlsx gets corrupted.\nI observed that the class had two extensions e.g MyClass.class.php . I removed the .class and it worked fine.\nA workaround is to rename all my classes to not have the .class extension but to be in MyClass.php format.\nBut I think this is something that needs to be fixed.\nÂ \nThank you",
