      "Message": "No I didn't test beforehand.... I never do, I simply dump a release on you lot and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nI know you don't think very much of me, but yes, I did run a full suite of tests before releasing, under 4 different versions of PHP... I try to be as professional with PHPExcel as I do with my work projects, which is why I'm trying to retrofit full unit testing, rewrite the new version cleanly so it is testable and to defined standards, produce full documentation, etc.\r\n\r\nIt's why I like to know what PHP versions people are using when they encounter problems, and what configuration settings they may have that could cause issues\r\n\r\nBoth 14excel5.php and 40duplicateStyle.php ran successfully in all my tests. I know that I missed a warning in the CSV Reader, but double-checking my logs that's the only erroneous output message that is displayed.\n",
