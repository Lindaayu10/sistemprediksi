    "Description": "I have the following code, \n\n=VLOOKUP(Sheet1!'A1',Sheet2!A1:B'.($newsheet->getHighestDataRow()).',2,FALSE) \n\nWhen the file was downloaded, the cell with vlookup formula is empty(no data, no formula). But when I tried to copy the formula to the excel file manually, the formula returns correct output. How can I resolve this? I also tried alternative formula using INDEX and MATCH functions but I encountered the same issue. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank You!",
