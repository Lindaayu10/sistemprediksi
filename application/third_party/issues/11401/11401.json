    "Description": "It seems that if you're constructing a new Worksheet and there are others already with formulae, the ReferenceHelper::updateNamedFormulas gets called with the oldTitle of the worksheet, which seeing as it's new is an empty string.  This causes ReferenceHelper to call strpos with an empty haystack which throws an error which mucks up the Excel file!\n \nAdding \n    \tif( $oldName == '' ){\n    \t  return;\n    \t}\nat line 459 to disallow empty $oldName values seems to work - but no idea if this might break other things.\n \nThanks for the library, btw!",
