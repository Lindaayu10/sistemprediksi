      "Message": "It is correct that BIFF8 must use \"Workbook\", but BIFF5/7 must use \"Book\". This is according to \"Microsoft Office Excel 97-2007 Binary File Format Specification\".\r\n\r\nAs a consequence PEAR::Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer should use \"Workbook\", but only when the setVersion(8) flag is set. Since PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 is hard-coded to use setVersion(8) it should be updated accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis is also causing trouble in OpenOffice.org 3.1.0:\r\nWhen one opens an xls file created by PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 and chooses \"File > Save As\", the suggested file type is \"Microsoft 5.0 (.xls)\" rather than \"Microsoft 97/2000/XP (.xls)\" which is somewhat unfortunate:\r\n\r\nScreen shot of \"Save As\" dialog in OpenOffice.org 3.1.0 with default option shown:\r\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/6343/ooosaveas.png\r\n",
