    "Description": "Today I got Excel2003XML file which were read by csv reader. After looking in code, of file and canRead method of Excel2003XML class, I've found that signature checked is wrong:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?> is checked to be in file, but i had:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"windows-1251\"?>\nAs quick fix I used this code:\n$signature = array(\n\t'/<\\?xml version=\"1\\.0\".*?\\?>/',\n\t'/<\\?mso-application progid=\"Excel\\.Sheet\"\\?>/'\n);\n...\n$valid = true;\nforeach($signature as $match) {\n\tif (!preg_match($match, $data)) {\n\t\t$valid = false;\n\t\tbreak;\n\t}\n}\nBut I think encoding should be used, if provided.",
