    "Description": "Not sure if this is to be expected, but it seems like PHPExcel_Reader_Excel2007 refuses to load any xlsx file containing shapes such as rectangles, text boxes, etc. Error message:\n \nNotice: Trying to get property of non-object in /opt/lampp/htdocs/www/classes/PHPExcel/Reader/Excel2007.php on line 654\n \nFatal error: Call to a member function children() on a non-object in /opt/lampp/htdocs/www/classes/PHPExcel/Reader/Excel2007.php on line 696\n \nThis is happening with the latest source from SVN (changeset 11568). Also with PHPExcel 1.6.1\n \nCode snippet:\n \n$objReader = new PHPExcel_Reader_Excel2007();\n//$objReader->setReadDataOnly(true);\n$objPHPExcel = $objReader->load('test.xlsx');\n \nIf I include the setReadDataOnly(true), it is ok however, but then I lose all formatting.\n \nI am aware that PHPExcel does not currently support shapes, but I would still like that all \"ordinary\" data in an xlsx file can be read even when the spreadsheet contains shapes or text boxes. I have a situation where users are uploading xlsx spreadsheets (that may contain text boxes) where I need to read some data in the spreadsheet (but not the text boxes), but this doesn't seem to be possible because I am getting fatal error.\n \nI attached sample file that triggers the error.",
