      "Message": "You are right. This is confusing. The thing is just that this writer disk caching thing is not useful at all at the moment. Perhaps we should really not mention those in the documentation.\r\n\r\nThere is no point using those methods right now. The amount of PHP memory they save you is approximately the size of the generated file, typically less than 1MB. While the bulk memory usage by PHPExcel comes from the in-memory storage of the worksheet object, typically 100MB if you have around 10,000 cells. Saving 1MB out of 100MB is pointless.\r\n\r\nWhat we need is disk caching for the workbook rather than for the writer. This is being discussed here:\r\nhttp://phpexcel.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=6857",
