    "Description": "From thread:\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=40929\n \nWhat would it take to add support for controlling the size of a comment? That is the width and height of a comment.\n \nThere has already been similar feature request for PEAR Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer:\nhttp://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=14404\n \nHowever, that feature request applied only to BIFF5 Excel spreadsheets. Comments are not supported in that class for BIFF8 spreadsheets as when one uses the setVersion(8) option.\n \nDue to complexity of the way comments are stored in BIFF8, they are not yet supported in PHPExcel_Reader_Excel5 and PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 so this feature request applies to PHPExcel core plus PHPExcel_Reader_Excel2007 and PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007.",
