    "Description": "I use the API documentation bundled with each release a lot, it is good to get a quick overview of the methods for the various classes.\n \nStill, I am occasionally having trouble finding the various methods.\n \nExample:\n----\nI want to look up a method for the PHPExcel_Worksheet class. So I open the API documentation in my browser (Documentation/API/index.html). Now I click on \"PHPExcel_Worksheet\" under packages thinking that this will somehow bring me to the list of methods for PHPExcel_Worksheet, but it doesn't. Rather, I have to click on \"PHPExcel\" under \"Packages\" which is a bit counter-intuitive.\n \nSuggested fix:\n----\nInclude the class file containing PHPExcel_Worksheet in the PHPExcel_Worksheet package instead of the PHPExcel package.\n \nI believe that will make class PHPExcel_Worksheet display under \"Classes\" when you click on \"PHPExcel_Worksheet\" under \"Packages\".\n \nI have similar suggestion for the other classes that are packages themselves.\n \nWhat do you say? Is this against the conventions? I have no idea?\n \nP.S: It is also hard to find the PHPExcel_Style class methods. That is because it is included in the Package \"PHPExcel_Cell\", instead I suggest putting it in the PHPExcel_Style package\n \nEnvironment:\n----\nPHPExcel: 1.6.4",
