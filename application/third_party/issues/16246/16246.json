    "Description": "Hi,\nÂ \nrecently tried to read this csv file using phpexcel in cakephp. While the file is opened and read, the CSV read loads all of the lines into the first rowiterator array instance, rather than one line per rowiterator instance (i.e. I have ~10 lines in the file, but instaed of 10 rowiterator arrays, I get one with all the data in it).\nI think this may be due to the fact that the first field is empty, although this should be handled fine, it appears not.",

It seems this could be enabled inside the PHPExcel_Reader_CSV class. I enabled it serverwide for me, so it fixed things, but this could be a bit of a gotcha for those who don't know.",
