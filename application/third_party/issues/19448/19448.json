    "Description": "I have quite a big xlsx file, and it gets around 40 sec to process. Profiler shows, that 98% of that time is spent by PHPExcel_Shared_String::Substring() and to be more specific, by iconv_susbtr().\n\nIf, however, I just change the order that Substring would first try to use mb extension (which is quite available in our days), execution time reduces from 40 sec to only 3,5.\n\niconv_substr works too slow.",
