      "Message": "Suspect the problem is non-ASCII characters in the worksheet name Ärendelista. IF I change this to Arendelista (using Excel) then try to load, it loads correctly.\r\nThere's a few places I know where the ASCII character set is still required: for example, cell references in formulae that reference cells on other worksheets. This looks to be an example in the OLE Reader.",

      "Message": "Hi Mark and thank you for your response!\r\n\r\nHowever, saving the file in Excel (without doing any changes) will result in PHPExcel reading the file correctly. So it might not be the non-ascii characters causing this after all. Sadly, I cannot save all faulty excel files manually since this is supposed to be part of an automatic process, which handles lots of different files from various incoming sources.",

Sorry to be nagging about this, but this is of some importance for me.\r\n\r\nI tried the workbook in a commercial software and it worked fine, so now I'm thinking about buying a license for $59.
