    "Description": "Conditional Formatting in Excel 2007 does not allow the full range of formatting normally found when you format a cell.\nFor example, alignment and protection options do not appear in the Conditional Formatting style dialog box.\n \nMore importantly, with Conditional Formatting, Excel 2007 allows you to \"clear\" the format for any or each of the four tabs - number format, font, borders and fill.  The effect of this is that when the conditional formatting is applied, only the specifically selected formats will be applied - i.e. you can change font colour, without changing cell borders.\n \nWith PHPExcel, and the Excel 2007 writer, there is no way to say that a particular piece of formatting should be left \"as is\".  This means, if I have a conditional rule that applies to a range of cells - say, to change the background colour - PHPExcel will also change the font style of those cells as well.\n \nA simple fix could be done by allowing the \"Fill\", \"Borders\", \"Font\" and \"NumberFormat\" to be set to NULL, and change the Excel 2007 writer to detect the NULL and simply not write that part of a conditional format (dxf record).  However, this adds complexity everywhere else, as additional null checking would be required.",

      "Message": "I second this suggestion.\r\n\r\nA horizontal alignment on a conditional style, on a cell that is merged from 3 cells results in the value being displayed in the first cell and the last cell.  This is avoided by simply not having the alignment section in the conditional style, and letting it default from the cell style.",

      "Message": "This issue was closed because it was believed \"fixed\" in the 1.7.8 release. If you believe otherwise, then open a new issue, providing (if possible) a test case to demonstrate that it is still a problem.\r\n\r\nNote that there are some major changes to conditional formatting in the pipeline, not least being able to apply conditional formatting across a range of cells without explicitly saving the styling for each individual cell; so if part of that rework involved further investigation into conditional styles overriding cell styles or vice versa when they shouldn't, then it's likely to be addressed as part of that change.",
