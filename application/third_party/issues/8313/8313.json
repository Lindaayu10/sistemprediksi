    "Description": ">> Maarten wrote:\n>>Problem is C1== 0. This causes a division by zero error in PHP. Try setting precalculation to false or specify a non-zero value in cell C1 \n \nActually, this is not the problem. If you run the test case I sent you with C1 set to a non-zero value, the script still dies in the same place in what appears to be the same way. So something else must be going on.\n \nAnd, yes, I can set precalculate to false, and will. But I'm surprised that you don't consider this a bug, since \"=IF(C1=0,,)\" is the way Microsoft recommends handling cases where a divide-by-zero might happen when computing percentages or ratios. At a minimum, it would be very helpful to mention in the section of your documentation on setting formulas in cells, that this type of =IF() function is not correctly handled (i.e., not handled the way Excel handles it), and that precalculation needs to be turned off.\n \nThanks,\nDennis",
