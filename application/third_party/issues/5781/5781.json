    "Description": "Classes\\PHPExcel\\Reader\\Excel2007.php throws a warning on line 597.  On that line there is a foreach loop that is used to iterate through an array.  The problem is that it assumes that the array is not empty.  When it is empty, php will throw a warning that is ugly on the screen.  To fix this, I put the following if statement in front of the loop:\n \nif (count($xmlWorkbook->definedNames->definedName) > 0){\n \nThis counts the number of items in the array definedName.  If there are zero items, it skips the foreach loop.  When there are more than zero items, it goes into the foreach loop.  \n \nI have attached the changed version of Excel2007.php that fixes this problem.\n \nThanks,\nBlake Collins",
