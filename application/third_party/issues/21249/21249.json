    "Description": "I've used this PHPExcel class for .xls files prior to this with success, but this time I've been running into issues. Now, I'm trying to load and read a .xlsx file and can't even get past the load() function. \n\nI should mention I'm not getting any errors what so ever. None in the logs and none in the browser or console. It simply executes the code and returns nothing. \n\nThe file I'm trying to upload has formulas as well as links to other data sources (when I open the file it asks to update the links to retieve the latest data). This is what could possibly be causing the issues, but below is my initialization code for this PHP class:\n\n```\nrequire($modules . \"/PHPExcel/Classes/PHPExcel/IOFactory.php\"); \n\n$inputFileType = \"Excel2007\";\n\n$inputFileName = $_FILES[\"file\"][\"tmp_name\"]; // my file is being uploaded rather than hard coded\n$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader($inputFileType); // I've also tried to put the type inside here\n\n$objReader->setReadDataOnly(false); // also tried true, but neither seem to make a difference\n$objPHPExcel = $objReader->load($inputFileName);\n```\n\nCan anyone help me determine what is going on? If I change the file to a .xls and use the Excel5 input file type it seems to work. However, the Excel file will inform me that saving it in this format causes fidelity loss and possibly breaks the formulas/links within the file. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.",

      "Message": "Oh, not a problem. I have been altering the Excel file to see if I could get it to upload. Ultimately, I ended up opening up a fresh workbook with no values, formulas, or formatting. I then just stuck in some random numbers in one column and saved it as a .xlsx file. When I tried uploading it I received the same issue with no errors being shown in the logs. I don't even get my \"fail\" message from the output because it literally stops executing code on the $objReader->load() function for .xlsx files only. I took the same file with the one column and saved it as a .xls and it worked just fine. Are there any known issues with the Excel2007 reader?",

      "Message": "There are many known issues with all the Readers, but that only affect a very tiny fraction of a percentage of cases..... but generally, PHPExcel will completely ignore anything that it doesn't understand (such as form elements) so they shouldn't cause any problems. The Excel2007 Reader is normally more tolerant because it's simply looking for specific XML markup tags\r\n\r\nThe most common causes of failure are timeout and exceeded memory.\r\n\r\nwhat I can't do is tell you what the problem is without the ability to debug this specific case",

I ended up just converting the .xlsx file to a .xls and used the Excel5 reader. It's certainly not ideal, but at least it works for the purpose I'm trying to serve. \r\n\r\nI do know I'm not getting any timeout or exceeded memory issues and I even manual set both of these on my page to ensure this wasn't this issue. \r\n\r\nI just thought it was strange that I couldn't get the Excel2007 reader to function at all. With a completely fresh workbook, with just a value of \"10\" in cell A1, and it still doesn't work. I thought maybe the issue was due from formatting, formulas, linked data sources, etc., but after testing the Excel2007 reader in the way I did it appears the reader itself is \"broke\" (for lack for a better word). \r\n\r\nUltimately, this class still rocks because it beats having to perform the workaround approach and provides so many useful methods/functions to manipulate the reading/writing of data that would otherwise make it not even worth trying to perform the functionality this class provides.  \r\n\r\nI appreciate your time spent looking into this issue.

The one downloaded is broken down in multiple lines while the saved one shows a compact structure. I found no logical cause for this mismatch.\nI can say is not my dynamically generated file as I did a test using a couple of files from PHPExcel documentation (26template.xlsx and 27template.xls) and I got the same result.\nHave some found a solution for this? Thanks in advance.\n \n",
