These files loaded just fine before I updated from the repository.\n \nThe important lines of code there are:\n \n352: $rels = simplexml_load_string($this->_getFromZipArchive($zip, \"_rels/.rels\")); //~ http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/package/2006/relationships\");\n353:        foreach ($rels->Relationship as $rel) {\n \nWhich seems to indicate a problem in _getFromZipArchive which when I debug\n \n305: if (strpos($fileName, '//') !== false)\n \nshows that $Filename starts out as \"_rels/.rels\"\n \nand then on line:\n \n309: $fileName = PHPExcel_Shared_File::realpath($fileName);\n \nsuddenly changes to include a system file path: \"/home/developer/www/dev/public/_rels/.rels\"\n \nIs this a setting problem...or possibly a bug?\n \nAny ideas?\n \n----------\nCommenting out the call to realpath on line 78 in PHPExcel/Shared/File.php fixed the problem.\n \n78:   //$returnValue = realpath($pFilename);",

If this is working for everyone else, it must have something to do with my environment, but I'm using a fresh ubuntu installation so I can't imagine what that might be.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
