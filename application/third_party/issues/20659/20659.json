    "Description": "Hi Everyone,\n\nAs given in documentation of ver 1.7.9 on page 15 that we can retrieve a cell by doing:\n\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getCellByColumnAndRow(1, 8)->getValue();\n\n\nI want to know that is there any possibility that can I get 'Coordinate of a cell' by enter its row and column. For example, is there a function to which i input row and column and a cell (1,8) and it will return its coordinates (i.e. B8)?\n\nLooking forward for kind help.\n\nThank you.\n\nBest Regards\nDH",
