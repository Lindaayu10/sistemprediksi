    "Description": "Hi,\n\nFirst of all I want to thank you for your efforts in creating a very good library for reading and creating spreadsheet files.\n\nI noticed a problem and I want to inform you. The problem occur on opening an ods file with a reading filter set. The library will not read the entire file. I will attach a script and an ODS file where you can see what I'm talking about.\n\nThe bug exists in versions 1.7.8 and 1.8.0 (only these 2 versions I checked) in the file Classes/PHPExcel/Reader/OOCalc.php. The code with problems is:\n foreach($rowData as $key => $cellData) {\n             if ($this->getReadFilter() !== NULL) {\n                        if (!$this->getReadFilter()->readCell($columnID, $rowID, $worksheetName)) {\n                                    continue;\n                        }\n             }\nin version 1.8.0 is the line 485, in the version 1.7.8 is the line 515. The code should be change from:\n if (!$this->getReadFilter()->readCell($columnID, $rowID, $worksheetName)) {\n                                    continue;\n                        }\nto:\n if (!$this->getReadFilter()->readCell($columnID, $rowID, $worksheetName)) {\n                ++$columnID;\n                continue;\n                        }",
