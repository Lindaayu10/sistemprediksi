    "Description": "I have created the pdf file via mdf6.0 and PHPExcel is used to create the excel with the images, merged cells using version 2.1. Everything is working as expected, except the borders. It's not displayed for the merged cells and shows an ugly output.\n\nI have traced the code and the following lines from 1268 to 1270 influence the behavior,\n\n```\nif (!$this->_useInlineCss) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$cssClass .= ' style' . $pSheet->getCell($endCellCoord)->getXfIndex();\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n```\n\nThe borders are not added to inline style. Please help with the same.",
