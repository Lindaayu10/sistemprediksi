    "Description": "First of all, I would like to say what a great tool this is.  It's saving me a lot of time.\n \nThis bug I discovered seems to be that PHPExcel changes certain float type numbers by itself.  It only happens with certain numbers and I don't have any idea why.\n \nCode below will demonstrate this error with numbers that begin with 99 and end with .82.  But I ran into more ranges of numbers than this.\n \n<?php\nerror_reporting(E_ALL);\n \nrequire_once('../Classes/PHPExcel.php');\nrequire_once '../Classes/PHPExcel/IOFactory.php';\n \n$objPHPExcel = new PHPExcel();\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('A1', 99609.82);\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('A2', 99000.82);\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('A3', 990000.82);\n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'HTML');\n$objWriter->save(str_replace('.php', '.htm', __FILE__));\n?>\n \nThis code will output:\n \n99609.82000000001\n99000.82000000001\n990000.8199999999\n \nThis happens on HTML, PDF, and CSV.  I believe this will show on Excel too if no cell formatting is set.\n \nI'm running this on PHP 5.3.0/Windows XP and PHPExcel 1.7.2.\n \nThank you for your help.",
