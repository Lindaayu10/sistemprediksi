    "Description": "These features were disabled in PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 due to inherited bugs from PEAR Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer reported here:\nhttp://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=2010\nhttp://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=2146\n \nReported for this project:\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=30287\n \nReason for PEAR bug:\n----\nThe problem is that the built-in defined names for the repeating rows/columns and print area are always written in the Excel file as BIFF5 records (Excel 5.0 - Excel 95) even when the setVersion(8) flag is set. You then get a BIFF8 file (Excel 97 - Excel 2003) with BIFF5 records which is seen as invalid.\n \nIt seems that some work has already been done in the PEAR Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer to resolve this, but was just never finished. It should be possible to patch up the code and finish the job.\n \nRelated issue:\n----\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=7831\n(repeating rows/columns + print area depend on ability to store formulas with off-sheet references)\n \nEnvironment:\n----\nPHPExcel: Latest source from SVN (1.6.3+)",
