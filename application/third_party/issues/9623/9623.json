    "Description": "I have a workbook with named references, for example sheet1!A1 is called protocol_proceedure. I am using Excel5 to read this workbook which passess successfully but when it comes to writing the formula back this ->_func() goes into endless loop. The formula I am using is a simple formula =IF(protocol_proceedure=\"road\",protocol_road,0). If I replace these named references to the sheet-cell reference it works fine and the tokeniser returns the right tokens back, however what i am getting is endless loop causing Apache to crash. Any ideas?",
