    "Description": "Me thinks that the reason loading of large files falis is because of the memory used up by the styling attributes that need to be loaded. If an option to load the file with minimal style info is included, this would allow larger sheets to be opened because you don't have to cache style info. \nÂ \nAny comments?",
