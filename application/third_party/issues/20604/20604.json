    "Description": "I can't give code to do this because it seemed to be very server dependent. The following scenario worked on my local machine (windows) but not my ubuntu production server.\n\n1. Create Workbook\n2. Create Worksheet (not from createSheet but by new)\n3. Populate Sheet\n4. Call Workbook->addSheet(Worksheet)\n5. Get fatal error \"call to a member function hasMacros() on a non-object in ... phpexcel/Classes/PHPExcel/Writer/Excel2007/Worksheet.php :: 151)\n\nAll writers gave my some type of error, but this is the Excel2007 error. My thought is that the addSheet did not correctly set the parent sheet, and then that was null (looking at line 151 of Worksheet.php). My solution was to call createSheet and then pass that into the object that composes my sheet content.",
