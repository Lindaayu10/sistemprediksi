    "Description": "i am trying to get the last row that contains data in an excel workbook the problem is in some sheets i get the correct data but in other sheets i don't , i tried to change my code by using getHighestDataRow() instead of getHighestRow() but i keep getting the same results so i updated my PHPExcel library from PHPExcel_1.7.9_doc to PHPExcel_1.8.0_doc but the same result too .\n\nand the result is taking too much time to show up and when it shows up i found too many errors in the beginning of the page stuff like this\n```\n \"INSERT INTO invoicestep ( ids , quantity , idv) VALUES ( '','=AND(#REF!,\"AAAAAH9s+wA=\")','' ) \" \n```\nand in the bottom of the page i found the expected output\n```\nINSERT INTO invoicestep ( ids , quantity , idv) VALUES ( '68','26','723' ) \n```\n but i am wondering what is this errors ???",
