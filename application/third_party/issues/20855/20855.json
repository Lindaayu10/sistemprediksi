    "Description": "Now days, I am working with two .php files\n\nThe first call at second, (where I generate the file of Excel using phpexcel ) with $.ajax({ type: 'post'.....\n\nBut when I use the method POST the second PHP do not work fine. ( the page is blank).  \nI was checking and the problem seems to be with the instruction \"save('php://output');\"  (never download the file) because I can download the file to my machine by example \"save('/p.xlsx');\" .  \nIt only occurs when I execute the second php called from other php, \nusing the method POST ( I can call to second using href=.... and it runs well and download the file).  But I need to do it with POST..\n\nI dont konw if the problem is that I should have other sentence\n\nPlease I need your help urgently",
