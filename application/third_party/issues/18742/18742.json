    "Description": "I'm reading in a workbook with multiple sheets, modifying it, then writing it back out.  One of the sheets has the first 4 rows repeating.  After writing the workbook out, the repeating specification is gone.\n\nThe problem appears to be (line 1579 Reader/Excel2007.php in v. 1.77):\n\n    elseif (preg_match('/^(\\d+)\\:(\\d+)$/', $range, $matches)) {\n\nHowever, the value of $range at that point is\n\n    'Profit and Loss'!1:4\n\nso it doesn't pick it up.  I'm assuming the prefix is because the setting is only for the 'Profit and Loss' sheet.  \n\nIt works (for me) when I remove the anchor to the beginning of the string, but that may be the wrong solution in the general case.",
