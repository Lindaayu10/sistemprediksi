      "Message": "Sadly, because mbstring.func_overload changes functions like strlen(), strops(), etc, we'd need to write brand new versions of these basic functions to work in the original way (bytewise rather than characterwise), with the drawback of very slow performance for any blocks of code that need to use them. In practical terms, it would mean that it would take minutes to load or save even the simplest of spreadsheet files; and we already get enough complaints about performance.\r\n\r\nWhat CMS is dependent on mbstring.func_overload to modify standard string handling behaviour rather than using the equivalent mbstring functions?",
