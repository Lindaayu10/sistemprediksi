I'll need to read the specs to see how this information is actually stored in the workbook, add appropriate properties and methods to the PHPExcel_Comment class, and modify the readers and writers to support it.",

      "Message": "This is fun. I've modified all the existing readers - Excel2007, Gnumeric, OOCalc, Excel2003XML and Excel5 (both for BIFF5-7 and for BIFF8 files, which store cell annotations in totally different structures) - so they can actually read comments now. Next step is to read all the formatting as well, including alignment and rotation (Yes! Rotation is also an option for cell annotations), for those formats that permit it. Not all formats actually support formatting or alignment/rotation; and those that do all store it in totally different structures; so I'll be doing this step by step.\r\n\r\nHopefully, then, I can move on to the Writers.\r\n",
