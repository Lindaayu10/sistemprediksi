    "Description": "Currently their is only a getRowIterator() which returns a new instance of a row iterator each time. For the sake of simplicity it would be nice if a sheet had a static instance of a row iterator that way it is easier to contiguously display data on the page without having to keep track of the your current row iterator.\n \nI would additionally like to see a setPosition method in the PHPExcel_Worksheet_RowIterator class.\n \nThis could be implemented easily by a higher layer, but to me would make sense to put into the core component.\n \nI'll attach a patch when I get some stuff cleaned up.",
