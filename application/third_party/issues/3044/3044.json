    "Description": "Every file I create using PHPExcelWriterExcel5 is filled with some unwanted borders, only visible in the Print preview and not in normal mode. I haven't actually printed the file but I suppose the borders will still be there if I do so.\nFor example, this is the file 14excel5.xls from the Tests directory in print preview mode: \nhttp://img120.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screen1nu1.jpg\n \nThis is the same file, but generated by PHPExcelWriterExcel2007: (had to save and reopen because of the printing bug in excel)\nhttp://img238.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screen2tf8.jpg\n \nAny ideas?",
