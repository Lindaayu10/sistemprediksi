    "Description": "Sheet references in Excel5 writer do not work when referenced sheet title contains non-Latin (I have tested Russian) symbols. In Excel 2007 writer everything is OK. \n \nSheet references are created using Microsoft Excel 2007 (not by PHPExcel itself - did not test this way), then template is read with Excel2007 reader and saved with Excel5 writer - columns become empty. \n \nI think the following problem is connected with this one: let's say we have a named range on list, whose title contains non-Latin symbols - if we reference this named range from another list and then save using Excel5 writer - columns become empty too.",
