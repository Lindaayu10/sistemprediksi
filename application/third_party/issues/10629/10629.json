    "Description": "Hi!\n \nWhen using PHPExcel 1.7.0 I detected some small error in calculation functions. \nI wanted to calculate a given formula:\n \n=VLOOKUP(N5;named_range;2;0)\nIn OpenOffice Calc the formula got calculated, but when reading the same spreadsheet in PHPExcel and using $sheet->getCalculatedValue() , I got #n/a error. Hovever, when I replaced named_range with exact cell reference, I got the correct result.\n \nWhile digging for the issue, I noticed that the vlookup() function received different matrix values - one time they were ordered by columns, another time - by rows. Invalid order caused this function to fail. Looking for the error cause I saw that PHPExcel_Calculation::extractNamedRange() and extractCellRange() methods were indeed returning cells indexed in different orders. I attach the diff file that corrects extractNamedRange() method. It helped in my case, but I don't know if there are no regressions though.\n \nCheers, \nKrzysztof Kotowicz",
