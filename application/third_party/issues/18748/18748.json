    "Description": "Dear PHPExcel team,\n\nI have found a small problem with the PHPExcel export to xlsx. It seems that the export is problematic when it has to deliver an excel file which has over 51 columns.\nThe problem is that for some reason, the column 52 (AZ) is not formatted properly. It contains data,but the data is not formatted as requested. Also, all other columns (BZ, CZ, etc) seem to suffer from the same problem.\n\nTo be more specific, I have taken the example 06largescale.php and changed the data creator to add more columns + some basic formatting (horizontal and vertical alignment to be in the center).\n\nBelow the code snippet:\n.......\nfor ($i = 1; $i <= 100; $i++) {\nfor ($j=0; $j <=100; $j++) {\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->setCellValueByColumnAndRow($j, $i, \"Content $j-$i\");\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getStyle(getColName($j).$i)->getAlignment()->setHorizontal(PHPExcel_Style_Alignment::HORIZONTAL_CENTER);\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getStyle(getColName($j).$i)->getAlignment()->setVertical(PHPExcel_Style_Alignment::VERTICAL_CENTER);\n}\n}\n......\n\nWhen exporting, all cells are aligned in the center/middle except cells on columns AZ and BZ. Also interesting is that even though my code writes data and formatting for the first 100 columns, the formatting is missing on columns AZ and BZ but is present on the columns 101 and 102 (CX and CY).\n\nCould you please check this issue?\n\nThank you.\n\nRegards,\nGhitza.",
