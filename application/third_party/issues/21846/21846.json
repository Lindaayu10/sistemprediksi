    "Description": "Hello,\n\nI am running a local WAMP server (v. 2.1) using PHP (v. 5.3.5) on Windows 7 Ultimate. I started with PHPExcel about 10 days ago. I started from the `'Hello World'` example given [here](https://phpexcel.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Examples&referringTitle=Home) and everything worked just fine. I gradually made changes and got the script working until I was sure I can put it online.\n\nBut as I uploaded the code to the web server, the exact code started returning `Error: Could not close zip file Hello.xlsx.`. I put `echo` statements at various places to see where things go wrong. the `PHPExcel` and `PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007` objects are being created alright and then this error comes up. My web server is running on FreeBSD 9.3 RELEASE and has PHP v. 5.3.29 installed.\n\nCan anyone suggest me how to resolve this issue...? Thanks in advance.",

      "Message": "From what I conclude so far is that this is happening because of write permission issues. I tried `objWriter->save('php://output');`. I managed to download the file but there seemed to be some encoding problem and the data wasn't displayed. MS Excel gave an error that either the file extension or the file format is not valid.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?",
