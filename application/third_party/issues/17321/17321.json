    "Description": "So I succesfuly create an .xlsx workbook for download where the user enters data and later uploads it back for retrieval. Here's the issue with the download; everything's fine for both versions. However, after uploading:\n \nUsing office 2010, everything goes as planned, using office 2007,  I get the error :\n \nMessage: ZipArchive::getFromName() [ziparchive.getfromname]: Invalid\nor unitialized Zip object\n \nFilename: Reader/Excel2007.php\n \nLine Number: 300\n \nZip is obviously enabled. Tried commenting the line 78 in Shared/File.php () as suggested in similar posts but futile. What could be the issue? Also not the anomally is inconsistent since I've tried on different machines office 2007 & worked...others didnt.",
