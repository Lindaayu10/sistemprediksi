    "Description": "In the \"06largescale.php\" test file, if I add a line return (\\n) and activate \"wrap\" for a cell, OpenOffice can't open it.\n\nexemple :\n```\n// Add data\nfor ($i = 2; $i <= 5000; $i++) {\n\t$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('A' . $i, \"FName $i\")\n\t                              ->setCellValue('B' . $i, \"LName $i\")\n\t                              ->setCellValue('C' . $i, \"Phone\\nNo $i\")\n\t                              ->setCellValue('D' . $i, \"FaxNo $i\")\n\t                              ->setCellValue('E' . $i, true);\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  $objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getStyle('C'.$i)->getAlignment()->setWrapText(true);\n}\n```\nFor a limited loop (for exemple 100), OpenOffice can open it but data are repeated (in the C column).\nmore I go down in the file, less data are repeated\n\nexemple of content for the cell C1 :\n> Pho\nneNo 2Pho\nneNo 2Pho\nneNo 2Pho\nneNo 2Pho\nneNo 2Pho\nneNo 2Pho\nneNo 2\n\nAttached file is the result of a loop based on 100 items.\n\nIf I open the \"06largescale.xlsx\" with \"Microsoft Office EXCEL 2007\", there is no problem.\nIf the file is writed in \"Excel5\" (xls) format, there is no problem (on OpenOffice as well as on EXCEL).\n\nOpenOffice version : 3.4.1\n\nDoes anyone else have this problem?",
