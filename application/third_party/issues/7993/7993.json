Shown in MS Office Excel 2007 screen shot:\n \nhttp://img395.imageshack.us/img395/8201/excelzoomfeatureia3.png\n \nCurrently, we do not seem to have support for this feature in the PHPExcel core. \n \nNote that this is not the print scale (print zoom level) which is already supported in PHPExcel, but the zoom level for screen view.",
