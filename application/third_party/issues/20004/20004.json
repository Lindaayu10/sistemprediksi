Otherwise, when error reporting was suspended the connection reset occured.\nIt would seem that the calculation class opened in plus one instance working with .xls and the last __destructor cannot run well. At this moment I must disable the .xls import while I can make / get solution. \nHowever this plugin will be my favourite.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance...",
