    "Description": "Implement a BIFF reader module.  BIFF, (Binary Interchange File Format) is the format used for versions Excel 11 and earlier.  I've already implemented this in a proposal for pear, but decided to propose it for this project instead.  It supports BIFF 7 & BIFF 8 formats.\nÂ \nBy the way, might I suggest a consistent way for naming modules.  Either name the year, version or format, but not a variety of different ones ;)  Currently there's CSV, Excel5 and Excel2007.  Anyway, I suggest that this one's called PHP_Excel_Reader_BIFF or PHP_Excel_Reader_XLS.  If you name your modules after the extension or file format, then you'll be able to implement the other file formats.",
