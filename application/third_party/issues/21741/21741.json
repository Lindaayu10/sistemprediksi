    "Description": "Hi,\n\nI need expert support on the following issue.\n\nI generate CHART as per following code(only the last lines) which work absolutely fine-\n\n......................\n$objWorksheet->addChart($chart);\n$objWriter = new PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007($objPHPExcel);\n$objWriter->setIncludeCharts(TRUE);\n$objWriter->save($file_name);\n\nI have a code file working absolutely fine to create pdf from excel data. However, when I take attempt to capture the CHART as per code below, it is not shown in pdf file. Data is shown fine. Also a warning message is shown during pdf creation which is because of \"$objWriter->setIncludeCharts(TRUE);\" line.\n\nWarning: call_user_func_array() [function.call-user-func-array]: First argument is expected to be a valid callback, 'PHPExcel_Writer_PDF_tcPDF::setIncludeCharts' was given in PDF.php on line 73\n\n..................................\n$objWorksheet->addChart($chart);\n$objWriter = new PHPExcel_Writer_PDF($objPHPExcel);\n$objWriter->setIncludeCharts(TRUE);\n$objWriter->save($file_name);\n\nIs there any straight method to do so? If not, then I suppose, by first rendering CHART into jpeg and then showing it in pdf might be an option. Please suggest how we can do it if there is no straight method?\n\nThanks,",
