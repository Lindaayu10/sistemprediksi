      "Message": "No it isn't a bug..... the Default Value Binder identifies the appropriate data type based on the PHP datatype and value, and sets the Excel datatype accordingly (and also potentially number format masking if appropriate). Anything beginning with a `=` is treated as a formula, and assigned the formula datatype.\r\n\r\nYou can override this behaviour by using `setCellValueExplicit()` to assign the datatype (this defaults to string); or by using your own value binder\n",
