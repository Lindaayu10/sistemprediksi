I don't know (and I cannot know) where they get these files from or what they did to them.\r\n\r\nHowever, two excel files that both run into this issue are attached. Hopefully this can help understand what's going on.\r\n\r\nAs for the workaround, yes, it's definitely not the best one, but still I believe it makes sense from a resiliency pov: \r\n\"if for whatever reason you don't have any style associated to a cell, don't try to use that style (and possibly log some debug statement if running in debug mode and/or return a list of warnings)\".\r\n\r\nCheers",
