The following \r\n$maxCol =$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getHighestColumn();\r\n$colsno = PHPExcel_Cell::columnIndexFromString($maxCol); \r\nwere working well as values but didn't correspond to the true, because in my xls for example i had filled till column E but  getHighestColumn(); returned P and then columnIndexFromString($maxCol); returned 16.\r\nBefore my post i was made sure that between the enviroments there are no differences.",

This should move the cursor to the highest column/row.\r\n\r\nIf you're getting an error with PHPExcel_Reader_CSV::setReadDataOnly() then the IO Factory hasn't been able to determine that $targetFile is an xls file (or any of the filetypes that PHPExcel can handle) and is dropping through to the default CSV reader, which doesn't have a setReadDataOnly() method. Please verify that $targetFile is a genuine Excel5 file, not simply a file with an extension of .xls",
