    "ClosedComment": "Fixed in SVN\n\nAs a bonus, there is a great improvement in performance when writing images using PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5.\n\nTry a plain file conversion (read/write) of an xlsx file to xls of a workbook containing one JPEG digital photo 3008x2000 pixels.\n\nOn a shared web hosting account, the results were:\n\nUsing PHPExcel 1.6.5:\n----\nExecution time: 4min 8sec\nPeak memory usage: 92 MB \nGenerated xls filesize: 17.8 MB\n\nUsing current source from SVN:\n----\nExecution time: 0.77 sec\nPeak memory usage: 15.5 MB \nGenerated xls filesize: 0.685 MB ~ approx. size of input\n\n\nNotes:\n\n* PHPExcel_Reader_Excel5 is still slow for reading images. If you want to create xls files from template using images, use an xlsx template\n\n* Avoid using GIF images if you can with PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5, there is no native support for GIF in Excel 5.0 ~ 2003, therefore PHPExcel will have to convert to PNG which is expensive.\n\n* Attaching the new 14excel5.xls for reference.",

    "Description": "When one creates an xls file using PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5, then the images do not show when one opens the file in OpenOffice. Try with attached sample file.\n \nThis is probably because the images are stored using the (old?) IMDATA record (0x007F) and not the MSODRAWING record (0x00EC). OpenOffice does not seem to recognize the IMDATA record.\n \nIt would be better if PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 stored images using the MSODRAWING record not only for the above reason, but file sizes can also become quite large since IMDATA stores bitmap as uncompressed (I think).\n \nAt the moment I am not sure what it takes to solve this.
