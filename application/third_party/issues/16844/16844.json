    "Description": "Embedded CSV enclosures are being escaped according to RFC 4180 (see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180#section-2) by placing another enclosure next to it, like in \"aa\"\"bb\", but NOT by placing a backslash in front of it, like in \"aa\\\"bb\".\n \nIn order to be RFC 4180-compliant, lines 252-254 of Classes/PHPExcel/Reader/CSV.php in PHPExcel 1.7.6 Production should also read $escapeEnclosures = array( $this->_enclosure . $this->_enclosure ); instead of $escapeEnclosures = array( \"\\\\\" . $this->_enclosure, $this->_enclosure . $this->_enclosure );\n \nIn the current implementation, a text containing backslashes like [%url; \"http://example.com/\"; \"Read more\"; \"style=\\\"color:blue\\\"\"] and escaped as CSV field as \"[%url; \"\"http://example.com/\"\"; \"\"Read more\"\"; \"\"style=\\\"\"color:blue\\\"\"\"\"]\" would become unescaped as [%url; \"http://example.com/\"; \"Read more\"; \"style=\"color:blue\"\"]: The backslashes are missing.\n \nYet I know, there isn't any CSV standard and there are implementations where the enclosure and even the field separator are being escaped by a backslash (read http://www.creativyst.com/Doc/Articles/CSV/CSV01.htm for instance). So you would in principle need two or more configurations of PHPExcel_Reader_CSV in order to support them all. The current configuration, however, tries to support a bit of each CSV implementation and finally isn't compatible to any single one.",
