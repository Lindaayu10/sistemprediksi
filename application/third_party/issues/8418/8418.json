    "Description": "PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 is currently using PEAR Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer's mergeCells() method for writing merged cell ranges.\n \nWhile output is working ok, it is unfortunately not storing data efficiently, as it uses one full record per merged cell range.\n \nBundled with PEAR Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer is also the method setMerge() for doing the same thing, but which stores multiple merged cell ranges in one record. \n \nUnfortunately, it is not constructed correctly, as it may lead to MERGEDCELLS records being split by CONTINUE records which is not allowed per section 5.67 in OpenOffice.org's Documentation of the Microsoft Excel File Format.\n \nHence PEAR bug #8967:\nhttp://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=8967\n \nIn this work item we fix PEAR's setMerge() method so we can use that one instead of PEAR's mergeCells(). After doing that, mergeCells() method can be eliminated from the class.\n \nEnvironment:\n----\nPHPExcel: Latest source from SVN (1.6.4+)",
