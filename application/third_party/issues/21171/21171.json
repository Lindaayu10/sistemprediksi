    "Description": "I'm generating a Excell 2003 using this code:\n\n```\n    $objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel5');\n    $objWriter->save('toUploadFtp.xls');\n\n```\n\nAnd I can read the file with MS Excell and LibreOffice. But I have to upload the file to a system that says the format has to be Excell 2003, and he prompts next error:\n> Oops! Your file is not in the proper Microsoft Excel 2003 XLS format.\n\nIf I open the file with LibreOffice and save it again, then I can upload the file correctly to the system.\n\nAny idea?",

As far as I'm aware, the Excel5 Writer generates a fully-compliant BIFF-8 format file; and the fact that both MS Excel and LibreOffice can open the file without any problems suggests that this is the case.... but without knowing what application is rejecting the file, I can't even begin trying to figure out why.",
