    "Description": "Hi, I’m going to post several issues that I have in here.  I don’t know if you prefer for me to fill different tickets for each issue, so just let me know and I’ll separate them.  \n \n1. I was trying to copy a worksheet since I need to change a couple of values in each, but most of the info and format is the same.  I used the Clone function and it works fine copying the worksheets.  However, if I change the value in one worksheet, it changes the value in all of them.  I hope that there is an easier way to copy the worksheets and modify just the one that I want and not all of them but I just couldn’t find it.  So, it occurred to me to first save the file, and then open it again, modify it and save it with the changes and that brings me to my other issues.  \n \n2. Reader Excel5 is losing the formatting and images once it is open.  I saved the file but when I opened it again, I was able to change the data but I lost the formatting and images that I had inserted.  At the beginning I though I was doing something wrong and I was deleting the format in some way, so I tested it by just opening the file and saving it immediately (with a different name).  The result is that I lost all the formatting.  \n \n3. Since it is a temporal file, I tried Reader serialized.  I created the serialized file without a problem, but the reader is giving me the next errors: \n“Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in C:\\Program Files\\Apache Software Foundation\\Apache2.2\\PHP\\PHPExcel\\PHPExcel 1.6.2\\Classes\\PHPExcel\\Reader\\Serialized.php on line 78\nFatal error: Call to a member function getSheetCount() on a non-object in C:\\Program Files\\Apache Software Foundation\\Apache2.2\\PHP\\PHPExcel\\PHPExcel 1.6.2\\Classes\\PHPExcel\\Reader\\Serialized.php on line 81”\n \n4. Finally, I tried using the Reader2007 and I got the data only with the following warnings:\n”Warning: ZipArchive::getFromName() [function.ZipArchive-getFromName]: Invalid or unitialized Zip object in C:\\Program Files\\Apache Software Foundation\\Apache2.2\\PHP\\PHPExcel\\PHPExcel 1.6.2\\Classes\\PHPExcel\\Reader\\Excel2007.php on line 129\nWarning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in C:\\Program Files\\Apache Software Foundation\\Apache2.2\\PHP\\PHPExcel\\PHPExcel 1.6.2\\Classes\\PHPExcel\\Reader\\Excel2007.php on line 130”\nI tried using the $objReader->setReadDataOnly(false); but it still lost the formatting data (my guess is that it lost it because of the warnings).  I’m using PHP Version 5.2.0 and php_zip: enabled  \nExtension Version  $Id: php_zip.c,v 1.1.2.15 2006/09/24 22:27:57 pajoye Exp $  \nZip version  2.0.0  \nLibzip version  0.7.1  \n \nThank you,",
