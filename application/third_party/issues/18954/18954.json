    "Description": "I want to use frozen panes in a number of sheets.\nWhen I reset the active sheet to one sheet, only the before the active, the active sheet and the next sheet will have freeze panes if I use the Excel 5 writer. The Excel 2007 writer doesn't have this problem.\n\nI have attached a demo script to illustrate this issue. Change the active sheet index at line 18, to see the effect of the moving freeze panes.",
