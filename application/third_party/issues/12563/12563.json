    "Description": "It would be useful if the documentation featured a cross reference showing the different features that are supported by the different readers/writers\n \nFor example: Excel5 reader/writer doesn't support formulae using functions from the advanced toolpack, whereas Excel2007 reader/writer does support these functions; and Excel5 reader/writer doesn't support certain operators (eg %) in formulae.\n \nA simple cross-reference table in the documentation could advise users of exactly what can and can't be done with the different readers/writers",
