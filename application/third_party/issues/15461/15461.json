    "Description": "I identified four occurences of linux/unix specific file notations in Calculation.php that lead to files silently not being found on my development system (XAMPP 1.7.3). The method setLocale() is populating the local variable $functionNamesFile with single forward slashes ('/') on at least four lines (1891, 1894, 1916 and 1918 in the 1.7.6 version of the code base)\nÂ \nI don't know about any \"silent replacement\" of slashes with backslashes by PHP on windows, but I had a real issue here with PHPExcel not finding my locale files. I fixed it with replacing any hard coded slash with the system independent \".DS.\" syntax, but then again, I'm using CakePHP and DS is defined early on in this framework. There might be a framework independent approach you might want to use for a proper solution. There might be other hardcoded slashes elsewhere, but I'm just giving you notice of a case where this was a real problem for me.",
