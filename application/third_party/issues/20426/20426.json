In that some of the dates are calculated based on other dates .\n\nThe issue which I am getting on this is some of the date fields it is subtracting one day automatically while uploading . But in the xlsx sheet it is displaying properly.\n\nFor example the attached file has column named __Final Approval (dd/mm/yyyy)__ .  when uploading this sheet first date and last date of column is uploading correctly. In between are not returning the exact date . Same issue with other columns also (Revisions (dd/mm/yyyy) , Review and Feedback (dd/mm/yyyy) ,First Cut (dd/mm/yyyy) ,File Upload Date (dd/mm/yyyy))\n\n\nAny idea what is wrong with the my code .
