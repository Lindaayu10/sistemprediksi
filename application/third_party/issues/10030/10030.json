    "Description": "Excel files containing formulas that are generated by PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 exhibit the following behavior in MS Office Excel (at least 2003 and 2007 versions):\n \nWhen the file is closed the following message shows:\n \nDo you want to save changes to 'myfile.xls'?\nMicrosoft Excel recalculates formulas when opening files last saved by an earlier version of Excel.\n \nSample file attached (write.xls)\n \nScreen shot of message:\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/2926/doyouwanttosavechanges.png\n \nWe are familiar with this message for Excel files with formulas that were created in an older Excel application such as MS Office Excel 2003 and viewed in MS Office Excel 2007.\n \nBut PHPExcel is supposed to model MS Office Excel 2007, and such message should not occur in neither 2007 and 2003 versions of MS Office Excel.\n \nEnvironment:\n----\nPHPExcel 1.6.7",

      "Message": "It turns out that this can be solved as follows:\r\n1. BOF record should be identical to the one of MS Office Excel 2007\r\n2. RECALCID record should be written\r\n\r\nWell, it doesn't solve the problem completely. But we now instead get the more friendly message:\r\n\"Do you want to save the changes you made to 'myfile.xls'\"\r\n\r\nScreen shot:\r\nhttp://img200.imageshack.us/img200/2581/savechanges.png\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if this message also could be eliminated. There is a work item for this which applies PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007 as well:\r\nhttp://phpexcel.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=10015",
