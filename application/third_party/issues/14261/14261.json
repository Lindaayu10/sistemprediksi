      "Message": "I may actually have identified a cause for this problem at long last: something that I stumbled upon in the Excel BIFF format documentation: it's a Double Stream File, a file saved as filetype \"Microsoft Excel 97 & 5.0/95 Workbook\", which contains 2 complete streams, one for BIFF5/7 format, the second as BIFF 8. In this case, only the BIFF8 stream should be read, not the BIFF 5/7 stream; but PHPExcel wouldn't recognise this difference. \r\n\r\nI now need to check if there is an equivalent in Excel2007, run some tests and see what I can come up with... I don't want to get my hopes up too much, but perhaps there is light at the end of this tunnel.\r\n\r\n",

The result is that you cannot read/write in the proper sheet!\nIt happens also that the bad sheets are sometimes NOT hidden, thus making huge files.\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\nThanks in advance.",
