    "Description": "So I have a table with the following format:\n\nA \"row\" of data is merged three rows in A, B and D while C is divided into three rows (A is name, B is ID, C is the three components, D is the date).\n\nI want to remove the rest of the formatted rows when the records from the database reach the end.  It also pushes the footer upward.\n\nBut when I use removeRow, it removes the content but the formatting of the rows (merged A, B and D, C is split to three) remains the same.   As a consequence, the footer gets poor formatting using the old row formatting.\n\nIs there anyway to delete the rows and delete their formatting as well?",
