    "Description": "This is an odd problem. I have XLS spreadsheets which contain merged cells. If the merge is from A to Z (or any combination within eg. D to G) the merge will still be there after editing the file using PHPExcel. If, however, the merge crosses from Z to AA then the whole merge is lost. So a merged cell from Y to AA will no longer be merged once opened and saved by PHPExcel.\n \nAny merges from AA onwards do not appear to be affected even if crossing from AZ to BA or from BZ to CA etc.\n \nI can only assume the issue is within the PHPExcel code as I can recreate this with a completely blank spreadsheet or one with pre-existing data. I suspect it is having an issue with merges from single character column references to double character column references.\n \nIs this a known problem and, other than redesigning my spreadsheets so that merges do not cross this boundary, is there a solution? I haven't been able to try it, but does anyone know if this problem also exists when using the newer XLSX format?\n \nThanks for any advice or info on this.",
