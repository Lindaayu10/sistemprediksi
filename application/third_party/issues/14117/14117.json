The PHPExcel Excel5 reader is only capable of reading genuine xls files, not html files masquerading as xls.\r\n\r\nIf you use the appropriate reader to try and read this file, it will throw an exception:\r\n\r\n$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel5');\r\ntry {\r\n\t$objPHPExcel = $objReader->load('33246.08Z93_STATO_AVANZAMENTO_PRATICHE_PDA_26-08-2010.xls');\r\n} catch (Exception $e) {\r\n\tdie ($e->getMessage());\r\n}\r\n\r\nwill return:\r\n\r\nThe filename 33246.08Z93_STATO_AVANZAMENTO_PRATICHE_PDA_26-08-2010.xls is not recognised as an OLE file\r\n\r\nYou should be doing this anyway, rather than relying on the loader's auto-identification, because it is more efficient.\r\n\r\nI\r\nf you try reading using the loader's auto-identification:\r\n\r\ntry {\r\n\t$objPHPExcel = PHPExcel_IOFactory::load('33246.08Z93_STATO_AVANZAMENTO_PRATICHE_PDA_26-08-2010.xls');\r\n} catch (Exception $e) {\r\n\tdie ($e->getMessage());\r\n}\r\n\r\nthen no error will be returned because the file will be loaded using the default method, which is to treat it as a CSV file; but because the data isn't genuine CSV data it will simply load each line of the file into column A (unless by chance it finds a comma in the data).\r\n",
