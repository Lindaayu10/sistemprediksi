    "Description": "The features list includes:\n \n\"Output your spreadsheet object to different file formats\"\n \nI currently use the PEAR Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer which works well. Shortly I need to support Excel 2007 file creations but also backwards support older formats.\n \nDo you have a time frame for when other file formats will be available and will they be older versions of Excel?",
