    "Description": "Hi guys,\n \nFirst of all thanks for the amazing PHPExcel lib\nI found out that we were outputing a lot of columns and so we would get into this error: Message: Invalid cell coordinate\nAnd the error was here\nPHPExcel/Worksheet.php(991): PHPExcel_Cell::coordinateFromString('[1')\n \nDo you not allow more than the Z column? Can you test it out?",

      "Message": "Hi  Mark,\r\nYou were right it is possible to add more rows.  It was our mistake.\r\nWe were adding cell values like this:\r\n\r\nforeach($setup['fields'] as $key){ \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t$col = chr($i); $i++;\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t$sheet->setCellValue(\"{$col}1\", $availableFields[$key]->getLabel());\t\t\r\n\r\nAnd then after Z it was [ so that was our mistake.\r\n\r\nWe decided to make a quick fix like this\r\n\r\nforeach($setup['fields'] as $key)\r\n\t\t{ \r\n\t\t\tif($i > 90){\r\n\t\t\t\t$i = 65;\r\n\t\t\t\t$second_level = true;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tif($second_level){\r\n\t\t\t\t$col = chr($i); $i++;\r\n\t\t\t\t$col = \"A\".$col; \r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\telse{\r\n\t\t\t\t$col = chr($i); $i++;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t$sheet->setCellValue(\"{$col}1\", $availableFields[$key]->getLabel());\t\t\r\n\r\nSo our users could get at least two times the alphabet but we were trying to guess how did you increment the col in an easy way.\r\n\r\nAnyway you can close this issue.\r\nThanks very much for the fast reply and again for your  amazing lib.\r\n\r\nAndré Moniz\r\n\r\n",
