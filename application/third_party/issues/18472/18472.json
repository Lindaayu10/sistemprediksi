    "Description": "If you hide all unused columns and rows in Excel, the resulting file is no bigger than previously.\n \nIf you do it in PHPExcel, as follows, the file is orders of magnitude larger, and unusable:\n \nfor ($col = 'E'; $col != 'XFE'; $col++)\n   $sheet->getColumnDimension($col)->setVisible(false);\n \nfor ($row = '28'; $row != '1048577'; $row++)\n   $sheet->getRowDimension($row)->setVisible(false);\n \nPlease don't say you shouldn't be doing this, etc. - I can't control how my analysts want to present their data, and it works in Excel. Thanks!",
