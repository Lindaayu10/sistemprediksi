    "Description": "When setAutosize() is used on Date fields, the resulting size is too small. Probably its looking at the number of characters of the integer (date value) instead of taking the formatting of the date into account. I.e. \"Wednesday August 26 2008\"  (date integer value 40051) should be auto-sized against 24 characters instead of 5 characters.",
