    "Description": "Hi. I'm having problems iterating through the rows of a sheet. I have an Excel file (.xls) with several sheets, and I'm trying to iterate over all of them like so,\n\n```\n$objPHPExcel = PHPExcel_IOFactory::load($this->spreadsheetsFile);\n$props = $objPHPExcel->getProperties();\n\n$allSheets = $objPHPExcel->getAllSheets();\nfor ($n = 0; $n < count($allSheets); $n++) {\n     $currentSheet = $objPHPExcel->getSheet($n);\n     $iterRow = new PHPExcel_Worksheet_RowIterator($currentSheet, 1);\n     while ($iterRow->valid()) {\n          $curRow = $iterRow->current();\n          // do things\n          $iterRow->next();\n     }\n}\n```\n\nI've also tried using \"foreach ($currentSheet->getRowIterator() as $curRow)\" instead of a while loop. In either case, the code loops forever, even though there are only about 500 rows in the sheet. Just out of curiosity, I print out \"$currentSheet->getHighestRow()\", but this value just increments by one with each iteration of the loop. I thought it would be a consistent value. So my question is, what am I doing wrong? Is it an issue with my Excel file itself or the code? Why does the valid() function always return positive, even when there is no data in the entire row? Thanks in advance for any help.",
