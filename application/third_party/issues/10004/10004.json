    "Description": "From thread:\nhttp://phpexcel.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=56663\n \n----\nSo I downloaded the latest stable and the latest SVN versions, which show the same signs of... let's say \"strangeness\".\n \nSee, I edit my code in Eclipse and as soon as I loaded the library, the IDE jumped at my throat with those red Xs that hurt the eyes. I investigated the matter and found what is obviously Java code in the middle of the JAMA directories. After a little research my guess is the files in question are an adaptation of the original JAMA Java package, and quite possibly a work in progress. As I may never include said files (my downloading the latest files was just to correct a value type issue I had with Excel5), can I assume it is safe to comment this code out ?\n \nThanks in advance.",

But I didn't particularly check any of the example or documentation files for JAMA. Of course, it was originally a java package ported to PHP: the original porters obviously didn't convert it all",
