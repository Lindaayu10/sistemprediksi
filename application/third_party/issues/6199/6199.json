    "Description": "When unserializing a serialized PHPExcel object, I get about 100 warnings 'Warning: unserialize() [function.unserialize]: Node no longer exists in [....]/Reader/Serialized.php on line 78'. The object however seems to be working fine.\n \nThe PHP manual explicitly states 'Note: It is not possible to serialize PHP built-in objects'.\nI think there is a problem with the member variables of the type SimpleXMLElement, which is a PHP built-in object.\n \nI tried a lot but unfortunately I haven't got any hint on resolving this problem.",
