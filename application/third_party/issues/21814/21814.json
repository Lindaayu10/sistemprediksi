    "Description": "I am retrieving data from a database and creating an html table as well as an excel spreadsheet with the data. \n\nThe problem is that the excel spreadsheet inserts FALSE into the Description column for certain data. I suspected that the data I am pulling may be the issue but I can not find anything different from the data that actual is represented right in the excel sheet. \n\nI have attached my PHP code to this post and I can provide the excel sheet if needed.\n\n      __Data that is being represented correctly in excel sheet __\n\n         <p><strong>Phillips 66 Type M Aviation Oil 20w-50 - 55 Gallon Drum</strong></p> <p>Phillips 66 Type M Aviation Oil 20w-50 is an ash-less, non-dispersant, multi-grade engine oil SAE 20w-50 grade. This aviation oil is recommended as a mineral based engine oil in aircraft piston engines that does not have dispersant additives. Phillips 66 Type M Aviation Oil 20w-50 stands out among single-grade oils because it provides an easier starting and a faster circulation of oil at low temperatures. This aviation oil does this while keeping a high film strength at high temperatures and under intense pressure for better protection against wear and piston scuffing. Phillips 66 Type M Aviation Oil 20w-50 is particularly recommended and typically used as an all-mineral, break-in oil for overhaul engines. The formation of this multi-grade oil reduces cylinder glazing tendency during break-in and lasting in less than 25 hours.</p> <p><strong>Product Data Sheet:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MSDS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.shoppsc.com/pdf/Phillips%2066%20Type%20M%20Aviation%20Oil%20PDS.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"AeroShell Oil 65 Product Data Sheet\" src=\"http://aviationoiloutlet.com/image/data/pdf_icon.png\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 80px;\" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://w3apps.phillips66.com/netmsds/results.aspx?qfield_type=1&amp;qfield_value=047810&amp;language=AMERICAN%20ENGLISH\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"AeroShell Aviation Oil 65 MSDS\" src=\"http://aviationoiloutlet.com/image/data/pdf_icon.png\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 80px;\" /></a></p> \n\n\n      __Data that is NOT being represented correctly in excel sheet__ \n\n                   <p><strong>Phillips 66 X/C Aviation Oil 20w-50 Engine Oil - 55 gallon drum</strong></p> <p style=\"line-height: 15.6pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">Phillips 66 X/C Aviation Oil 20w-50 Engine Oil is a multi-grade engine oil that is specially designed to for year-round use in aircraft piston engines. Because this aviation oil is a multi-grade instead of a single-grade, it has more performance based benefits. Phillips 66 X/C Aviation Oil 20w-50 Engine Oil is easier to start up and oil circulates faster at low temperatures. It also has reduced warm-up time, and reduced oil consumption in most engines on the market. Phillips 66 X/C Aviation Oil 20w-50 Engine Oil protects against wear and piston scuffing by being able to maintain the oilï¿½s film strength at extreme load weights and at high temperatures. This engine oil uses X/C ash-less dispersant technology to inhibit the build-up of sludge, varnish, piston deposits and combustion chamber deposits. By being able to resist the different types of build-ups it has a much cleaner engine compared to the use of non-dispersant mineral oils. Phillips 66 X/C Aviation Oil 20w-50 Engine Oil was the first FAA-approved mineral oil-based, ash-less dispersant, multi-viscosity aviation engine oil. Phillips 66 X/C Aviation Oil 20w-50 Engine Oil has more than 20 years of excellent and proven performance in aviation applications. These include flight schools, charter and cargo airlines, acrobatic aircraft, spray planes, race planes, and virtually any other general aviation application.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p> <p><strong>Product Data Sheet:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MSDS:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.shoppsc.com/pdf/Phillips%2066%20XC%20Aviation%20Oil%20PDS.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"AeroShell Oil 65 Product Data Sheet\" src=\"http://aviationoiloutlet.com/image/data/pdf_icon.png\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 80px;\" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://w3apps.phillips66.com/netmsds/results.aspx?qfield_type=1&amp;qfield_value=027440&amp;language=AMERICAN%20ENGLISH\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"AeroShell Aviation Oil 65 MSDS\" src=\"http://aviationoiloutlet.com/image/data/pdf_icon.png\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 80px;\" /></a></p>",
