    "Description": "Test:\n----\n$excel = new PHPExcel();\n$writer = new PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5($excel);\n$writer->save('blank.xls');\n \nExpected result:\n----\nExcel file with 1 blank sheet\n \nActual result:\n----\nAs expected, but when opened in MS Office Excel 2007, you get this message:\n\"File Error: data may have been lost.\"\n(May also be happening in MS Office Excel 2003 SP3, but have not tested)\n \nEnvironment:\n----\nPHPExcel: Latest source from SVN (1.6.3+)\n \nThe problem seems to be that incorrect values for the highest/lowest row/column are stored DIMENSION record. Apparently, this triggers an error in MS Office Excel 2007 (and perhaps also Excel 2003 SP3, but not with OpenOffice).\n \nStrangely, PEAR Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer (which PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 is based on) does not seem to have this problem, but this is probably just a coincidence because it is at the same time writing broken SHEET records in the case of blank sheets. Here two bugs seem to be canceling each other. Have not tested enough to say for sure, though.\n \nRelated posts:\n----\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=5008\nhttp://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=12848\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=4126",
