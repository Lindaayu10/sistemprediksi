    "Description": "There is no way to override system default tmp path in PHPExcel on PHP >= 5.2.1. This can lead to errors such as realpath() [function.realpath]: SAFE MODE Restriction in effect.  The script whose uid is #uid# is not allowed to access /path/to/system/tmp owned by uid #another_uid#. In my case I used to override this by setting $_ENV['TMPDIR'] to another dir. This does not work anymore.",

I haven't looked into the differences between Excel5 and Excel2007 implementation yet, but I can say that if I pass Excel2007 writer (and save to php://output) while everything else stays the same no warning is thrown.

      "Message": "an0nym, thanks for your patch. After thinking about this issue, I think we should instead try to get rid of all the stuff with temporary files in OLE and Excel5 writer classes.\r\n\r\nOver time, we got several bug reports where things are not working because of some platform restriction. Each time we think it is fixed, a new problem appears.\r\n\r\nI have made some changes in latest source code commenting stuff involving temporary files in Excel5 writer. Can you test and report back if it works?\r\n\r\nIf yes, we can make the changes permanent.",
