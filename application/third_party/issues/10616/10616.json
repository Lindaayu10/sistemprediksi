    "Description": "I'm using the following formula in my Excel 2003 file: \n=IF(SUM(G53:G60)=0;\"\";SUM(G53:G60)) \nbut after opening by excel5 reader and saving by excel5 writer it got removed.\n \nThe formula works as expected (and remains intact) after I've put the first SUM(G53:G60) into one pair of brackets so it looks like this: \n=IF((SUM(G53:G60))=0;\"\";SUM(G53:G60))\n \nI currently don't have time to look at the code, but I believe it's handy at least to report it.",
