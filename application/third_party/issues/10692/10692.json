Works Ok for Excel2007 writer.\n \nEx:\n \n// Add some data\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('C1', \"=NETWORKDAYS(A1, B1)\");\n \n \n$objWriterA = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel5');\n$objWriterA->save('text.xls'); //writes nothing in cell C1\n \n$objWriterB = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel2007');\n$objWriterB->save('text.xlsx'); //writes formula in cell C1 (as expected)\n \nVersion: 1.7\n \nTest file attached\n \nHope this helps improve",
