    "Description": "I've modified HashTables and Styles so that instead of generating a Style's HashCode all the time (which is fairly expensive) just to query the HashTable, each Style knows its index in the HashTable.\n \nI've also modified the Excel2007 worksheet so that it doesn't loop over every cell in a table to find its row and then check if its the same as the current row (the worst time of this was $total_rows * $total_cells!). It instead indexes each cell by its row and then does a quick lookup instead.\n \nFinally, Excel5 now goes over each Style only once instead of each recreating each Style on every cell.\n \nAll these patches combined make PHPExcel very fast (my test file went from 40 seconds to only 5 seconds).\n \nAgain, looking for any review(s). Thanks.",

      "Message": "I've not looked at the code implementation, or tested the performance; but the method makes perfect sense to improve performance. There's a slight overhead in checking the hashtable if the style isn't already stored there, plus the memory overhead in storing the hashtable; but most worksheets use only a few variants of style repeated for a large number of cells, so the benefits are clear.",
