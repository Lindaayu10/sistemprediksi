    "Description": "Ah! An epiphany! An error in a part of the script that writes a few functions (accidentally) wrote an indefinite circular reference, which caused the calculation engine to loop endlessly (and sucking up resources) as it tried to reach the end of the formula...\nÂ \nI guess circular reference checking should be added to the feature list?",

      "Message": "Modified the code to throw an exception or raise an error when it encounters a cyclic reference while calculating a formula.\r\nPlan to make further modification to allow behaviour to be modified in this circumstance in a similar fashion to Excel itself (either trigger an error, or allow x iterations of the cycle before returning a value).\r\nNeed to modify writer to trap for exception/error when calling getCalculatedValue, and make appropriate noises.\r\nShould probably also trigger a calculation when user modifies a formula so that this situation can be trapped immediately",
