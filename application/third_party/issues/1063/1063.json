    "Description": "Hi,\nI updated my initial Issue, but it is still in closed status, so I add another 'issue'.\nI'm am totaly new at CodePlex and do not know how to manage bug reports.\n \nI do think there is a problem with PHP Excel 2007 classes. The file I'm loading is a file created by PHP Excel 2007 classes. \n \n \nI had another look at my problem and I I think I know what's going wrong.\nI create a multi sheet Excel file, adding a sheet at the time. For each sheet I load the existing Excel file,add  a new sheet and save the file. At some time during this process the reader gets problem with this column value, most probably in the last sheet created. \nSo the XML file I load is infact an Excel XLSX file created by PHP Excel 2007 classes.\n \nIs there any method I can use to to set the encoding on Excel files I create with PHP Excel 2007 classes?",
