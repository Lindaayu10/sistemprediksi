    "Description": "It seems ExcelWriter5 is not PHP5 compatible, I get a bunch of PHP STRICT ERRORS:\n \nI've left an example script online for you guys to check:\n \nhttp://www.vcn-crm.nl/codeplex.php\n \nThe script shows the source code too, just click on the blue bar.\n \nI've tried simply removing the '=&' on the two lines, but then I get another STRICT ERROR:\n \n{\"Error: Non-static method PHPExcel_Shared_OLE::Asc2Ucs() should not be called statically, assuming $this from incompatible context\"}\nFile: PHPExcel/Writer/Excel5/Workbook.php\nLine: 578\n \nHere are my system specs:\nApache version\t1.3.39 (Unix)\nPHP version\t5.2.0\nOperating system\tLinux\nKernel version\t2.6.9-42.ELsmp\n \n{\"The example 14excel5.php works fine, however that is due to the set error level (E_ALL), setting this to E_STRICT (which my custom error handler does), results in a whole bunch of STRICT errors, including the one described here.\"}",
