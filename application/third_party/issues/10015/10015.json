    "Description": "From thread:\nhttp://phpexcel.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=56737\nÂ \nI'm having a problem with closing my generated excel2007 file. PHPExcel creates and saves my excel2007 file correctly. When I open the excelsheet I don't get errors and everything looks fine. But when I close the sheet (without making changes) I always get the message 'Do you want to save the changes you made to myfile.xlsx?' When I click yes and open and close the file again, the message doesn't show anymore. But when I click no, the message apears everytime I want to close the excel file. Did I do something wrong? Thanks in advance.",

Since we are creating compliant OpenXML, this is more of an Excel issue (or behaviour) than a PHPExcel issue.",
