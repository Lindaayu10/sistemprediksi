    "Description": "In the method Worksheet::calculateColumnWidths an excessive amount of memory is used with auto width calculation is enabled.\n \nI am producing a simple worksheet consisting of 24 columns and 102 rows.  When I turn autosize calculation on all of the columns the memory consumption increases by 15MB (it's only 5MB before that).\n \nI put memory markers (using firephp) FB::log(memory_usage()) inside the method to see a 15MB increase in memory usage. and specifically inside the 2nd foreach in the method (the one iterating over the cellCollection). Each loop increases memory usage by around 6K. (loop through 2448 times)",
