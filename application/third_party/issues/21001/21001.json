    "Description": "I am using phpexcel to create excel sheets. I collected all the data in to data array and inserted into excel in one shot, but some fields in my array are like '04567' but it is storing as '4567'. Is there any way so that I can set type_string on some columns. Here is a piece of code:\n\n$PHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->fromArray($data, null, 'A2');\n\n\nPlease suggest something. \n\nThanks\nSandeep",
