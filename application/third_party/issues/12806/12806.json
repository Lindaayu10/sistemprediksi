    "Description": "I have a 180+kb xls file (with formulas, styles and macros) which I read \n([code]\n$file = PHPExcel_IOFactory::load('invoices/xls/testFile03.xls');\n[/code]), change some values and the try to write to the browser as a 'Save File' prompt.\n \nI tried saving the (source) file as Excel 5, and then using the Excel5 writer it works out fine (less some styles, macros and formulas).\nIf I use the Excel2007 writer (with the original source file), the resulting file is corrupted, if I use the Excel5 writer I get a blank page on the browser and no 'Save File' prompt window.\n \nI'm using PHP 5.2.11 on linux\nApache/2.2.3 (CentOS) \nZend Framework 1.8.3\nPHPExcel 1.7.2\nOpenOffice 3.2.0\n \nMany thanks",
