      "Message": "Cause identified.\r\nEngine was doing a cellExists() test before trying to retrieve the value, returning a null if the cell didn't exist. However, it was testing to see if the cell existed in the current worksheet, not the named worksheet. So it would pass if a cell existed at the same row/column in the current worksheet, fail if it didn't, and therefore return a null even though the cell did exist in the named worksheet.\r\n\r\nFix will be uploaded to SVN this evening.",
