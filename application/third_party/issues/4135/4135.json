    "Description": "Could anyone tell me if it would be possible to Group specified rows so that they can be toggled visible and invisible by the user, This is usually done by using a plus sign that appears to the left of the grouped cells, so they can be toggled. If this is not possible, would it be difficult to implement? This is the only feature I still need.",
