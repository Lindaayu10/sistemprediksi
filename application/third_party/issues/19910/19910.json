    "Description": "Hello,\n\nWhen using SUBTOTAL in formula, other nested SUBTOTAL must be ignored to avoid double counting (http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/subtotal-HP005209288.aspx).\n\nThe actual version of PHPExcel (1.7.9) doesn't implement this specification. I have take some times to add this.\n\nYou will find attached on this issue a zip containing the patch and an excel file to reproduce this issue. The expected value for the cell A1 is 3, PHPExcel (1.7.9) gives 9 (=> A2 must not be used to compute A1 value).\nFeel free to review and correct the patch if needed.\n\nThanks,\n\nRegards,\n\nDamien Cl√©ment d'Huart\nKey Consulting",

      "Message": "Hi Damien,\r\n\r\nI applied your proposed patch and found a bug. for a cell with value =SUBTOTAL(9,E38,E39:E39) I get:\r\n\r\nFatal error: Call to a member function getParent() on a non-object in XXX\\MathTrig.php on line 1071\r\n\r\nI tried to trace the error, but failed in understanding enough to find a work around. It seems for the specified formula, MathTrig.SUBTOTAL() receives an array for $pCell, instead of the required object. Any proposed amendments that will fix this bug?",
