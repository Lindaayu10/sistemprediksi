    "Description": "I use this simple code from one of the example files to load a CSV and save to a file.\n```\n$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('CSV')->setDelimiter(',')\n                                                    ->setEnclosure('\"')\n                                                    ->setLineEnding(\"\\n\")\n                                                    ->setSheetIndex(0);\n$objPHPExcelFromCSV = $objReader->load('outputs.csv');\necho date('H:i:s') , \" File read from \" , 'outputs.csv' , EOL;\n\n\necho date('H:i:s') , \" Write to Excel2007 format\" , EOL;\n$objWriter2007 = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcelFromCSV, 'Excel2007');\n$objWriter2007->save(str_replace('.php', '.xlsx', __FILE__));\necho date('H:i:s') , \" File written to \" , str_replace('.php', '.xlsx', pathinfo(__FILE__, PATHINFO_BASENAME)) , EOL;\n```\n\nWhen I open the generated xlsx file, I see that all numbers which are stated in a scientific way in the CSV, are not recognised as numbers. I get an error in Excel stating 'Number stored as text'. \nThis is a part of the csv file: \n```\n2,1,16,h/h,,2.990e-13,5.600e-05,\n\n```\nI know a common problem is the char(160). This is not applicable here. If I add a formula stating\n```\n=0+F1\n```\nthen the number is displayed correctly as number. \nIf I open the CSV manually and save to xlsx, all numbers are also correctly stated. \n\nSo it seems to be related to PHPExcel. \n\nWhat can I do to overcome this issue?",
