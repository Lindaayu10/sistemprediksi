Also with PHPExcel 1.6.1\r\n\r\nCode snippet:\r\n\r\n$objReader = new PHPExcel_Reader_Excel2007();\r\n//$objReader->setReadDataOnly(true);\r\n$objPHPExcel = $objReader->load('test.xlsx');\r\n\r\nIf I include the setReadDataOnly(true), it is ok however, but then I lose all formatting.\r\n\r\nI am aware that PHPExcel does not currently support shapes, but I would still like that all \"ordinary\" data in an xlsx file can be read even when the spreadsheet contains shapes or text boxes. I have a situation where users are uploading xlsx spreadsheets (that may contain text boxes) where I need to read some data in the spreadsheet (but not the text boxes), but this doesn't seem to be possible because I am getting fatal error.\r\n\r\nI attached sample file that triggers the error.",
