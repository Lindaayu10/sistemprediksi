    "Description": "I've found an error evaluating a formula: VLOOKUP($E$4;$korslistor.$B$36:$P$54;H9;0)\n\nI'm referencing a range in the sheet 'korslistor' as $korslistor.$B$36:$P$54, so in Calculation.php line 3327\n$cellSheet = $this->_workbook->getSheetByName($matches[2]);\nIt's trying to get the sheet '$korslistor' instead of 'korslistor', so it doesn't get cell values for that range. In excel it works as spected, but PHPExcel doesn't get the correct sheet.\n\nIs this a bug?",
