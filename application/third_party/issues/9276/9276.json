    "Description": "Hi,\n \nWe have a problem when redirecting a phpexcel file to the client's web browser. It always adds the .htm extension to the file which gives an annoying error message when opening excel (see image).\n \nWe only have this issue on our development environment, which is: windows, php 5.2.8. With php 5.2.6 it works perfectly on windows.\n \nOn our test server which is ubuntu with php 5.2.8 we don't have that problem.\n \nThe code we are using is the following:\n \nheader('Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel');\nheader('Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=\"'.$filename.'.xls\"');\nheader('Cache-Control: max-age=0');\n$objWriter = new PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5($excelObj);\n$objWriter->save('php://output');",

When I test phpExcel without symfony it does everythin correctly except a new bug I found in the generation of excel2007. \r\n\r\nI created a new issue item for this: http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=9280.\r\n\r\nI'll try to find why the extension is not correct of phpexcel with symfony and post it here, although I supose this ticket can be closed , since (at first sight) it is not a phpexcel bug.",
