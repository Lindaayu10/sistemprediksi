    "Description": "Hi,\n \nI'm having issue when I want to load an Excel template, put some values in the sheet, and save changes.\nChanges are made, but some results of formulas make a \"#VALUE!\" error. However I just have to click on the formula and press Enter to force recalculation and the error disappears.  This is quite annoying for my project which automatically generates Excel files from a template and publishes it.\n \nHere is my code : \n$objPHPExcel = PHPExcel_IOFactory::load($file_in);\n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, \"Excel5\");\n$objWriter->save($file_out);\n \nAs you can see, even if I don't do anything else than saving, \"file_in\" is correct but \"file_out\" got #VALUE! error on most of the cells which contains formulas.\nIt's the same with different Excel format (Excel5 in/Excel2007 out, Excel2007 in/Excel5 out).\nWorking with Office 2003 and official patch for reading 2007 files.\nSee attached file for template concerned.\n \n \nSorry for bad English, i'm French.",
