You'll also find that it's the answer to half of the questions here on the discussion board.\r\n\r\nIt's not an \"issue\" with PHPExcel, it's standard PHP behaviour that if you echo something then it goes to php://output, and if you're also streaming the data from save() to php://output then the two will be combined",
