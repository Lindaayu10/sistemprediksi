    "Description": "Hi,\n\nI am feeling stupid today, so forgive me.  PphExcel 1.8 and Php 5.5\n\nI am using a VLOOKUP...\n\nWhen I write it out and load the file in excel everything is good, but when I try and get the resolved value in phpExcel... in variably I get 0... which is the wrong result.\nNot sure, but maybe it is because it is on a different sheet\n\nthe formula I am using is \n\n=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(V3,zLOOKUPS!A2:B3,2,FALSE),zLOOKUPS!B1)\n\nThe value in V3 is a string and the result coming back from the lookup should be a numeric... I think it is returning 0 because that is what is in the B1 cell... but surely it should not be error-ing in the first place.\n\nDriving me a little bit nuts.",
