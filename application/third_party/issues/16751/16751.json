    "Description": "Hello,\n \ni noticed today, that when you use the phpexcel with the apc cache and the apc gets filled up PHPExcel fails with the exceptions in apc.php on line 94 etc.\nI use the latest stable version 1.7.6\n \nit's easy to recreate:\n \nset your apc.shm_size to \"2M\" for test\nset cache method to APC (i think memcache should have the same issue)\nload big excel file\nwrite big excel file\n \nafter a while filling up the apc the writing stops with the exception: \nthrow new Exception('Cell entry '.$pCoord.' no longer exists in APC');\nAPC.php:93\n \nIt would be better to see if the entry is cached (and not indexed) because the cellList in baseCache is not updated when APC shifts cache entries out of the memory\n \nBest regards\nPhilipp",
