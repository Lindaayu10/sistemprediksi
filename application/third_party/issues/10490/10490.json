OpenOffice.org says result is 0.\n \nScreen shots:\n \nMicrosoft Office Excel 2007:\nhttp://img201.imageshack.us/img201/9871/ss20090820223745.png\n \nOpenOffice.org 3.1.0:\nhttp://img201.imageshack.us/img201/2123/ss20090820223725.png\n \nEnvironment:\n----\nPHPExcel 1.7.0",

      "Message": "Initial fix checked into SVN to resolved the use of fractions in simple arithmetic formulae (cell references or strings); but will take more work to process when included within a matrix, or a named range, or passed to a function.\r\nCreated a helper method in PHPExcel_Shared_String for validation and conversion of string fraction to a numeric value so it will be available in functions and matrix arithmetic in due course.\r\n\r\nBehaviour emulated is currently Excel compatible: no check made to see if calc engine is set to Open Office or Gnumeric mode.",

      "Message": "Thanks you for the fix, Mark. I can verify that it is working.\r\n\r\nI have one comment which I think is perhaps good news:\r\n\r\nI just tried to enter a formula like this in MS Office Excel 2007:\r\n=1 1/2\r\n\r\nResult was that Excel automatically sanitized the formula to this:\r\n=1.5\r\n\r\nTherefore I think there is no risk encountering formulas and matrices with fractions. This makes sense because I know for sure that there is no way to store a formula like \"=1 1/2\" in BIFF8, so probably not in Excel2007 either.\r\n\r\nIf anything, formula sanitization: \"=1 1/2\" -> \"=1.5\" would be a feature in the advanced value binder. Now, that is really a feature for the Excel purist!\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think this worked item can be set to status \"Fixed\". Am I correct, Mark?\r\n",

The PHPExcel functions do try to emulate all these strange behaviours (of which there are many)\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded in the fraction as a string handling for unary operations, and for matrix arithmetic. \r\n\r\nThat still leaves all the functions, but those will have to be handled on a case by case basis.\r\nAs such, I'm now happy to flag this issue as fixed... and I'll work through all the functions individually",
