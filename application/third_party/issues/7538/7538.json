      "Message": "Some initial tests are going fine. But right now the problem is that even small images will usually be split in multiple records in the xls file because of the record size limit. Modifications in the code are necessary in order to deal with the CONTINUE records. So far, CONTINUE records are only treated correctly for the shared strings.",

      "Message": "Basic image support should now be in place. I did some testing, and I think after all it is safe to include this already in release 1.6.5. \r\n\r\n27imagesexcel5.php does plain read/write from xls to xls/xlsx of a workbook with GIF / PNG / JPEG iages.\r\n1) xlsx output is ok, but since Excel5 reader still does not support image options, the scale factor is lost.\r\n2) xls output is as expected, but with the problems as described here\r\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=7994\r\n(Will try to fix this next)\r\n\r\nSome extra helper classes have been added together with the shared ones. These are used for intermediate representation of the Office drawings. They are used by Excel5 reader - later maybe also by Excel5 writer when that one is fixed.\r\n\r\nMaarten, if this needs to be organized in some other way, just let me know.",
