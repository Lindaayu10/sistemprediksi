    "Description": "I've attached the extension i've been using for a while of PHPExcel_Worksheet. I feel that the method rowIteratorInstance() is useful because you can track where you are at in your worksheet through the iterator rather than having to check for last row. I can create a diff if it is more helpful, but it's more time consuming to do.",
