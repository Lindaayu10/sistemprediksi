    "Description": "Despite the ability to set many of the style attributes of a cell containing a hyperlink, you cannot\nachieve the \"changing\" appearance of a simple hyperlink to mimic one created in Excel 2007.\n\nI have added the changes to PHPExcel 1.7.9 to do that.\nIn short, the changes are to 3 files in writer/Excel2007;\nwriter/Excel2007.php, writer/Excel2007/Styles.php, and writer/Excel2007/Worksheets.php\n\nIf you include any hyperlinks on any worksheet, then the writer will emit the additional fonts and styles needed to achieve the Excel 2007 default behavior of a hyperlink.  When the cells are emitted, if the cell is a hyperlink with no other style attributes, then its style will be set to the \"builtin\" style for a hyperlink.  The result is underlined blue text that turns purple after the link is clicked.\n\nI hope you find this useful. (This may be more appropriate for the discussion forum, but I have entered it here so I could provide the changed source files.)",
