    "Description": "When I insert a graphic, like a GIF or PNG using PHPExcel_Worksheet_Drawing, then open up the resulting XSLX file in Excel 2007 or Open Office, the image has been scaled slightly, making it appear blurry.  If I right-click on the image and select \"Original Size,\" the size is corrected and the image looks fine.\n \nThis happens even if I set the size explicitly in the code, and the ResizeProportional setting doesn't appear to affect it, either.\n \nI have a 230x70 GIF (attached), and use the following code.  I've tried it with and without the setResizeProportional() and setWidthAndHeight() calls, but it's always displayed at the wrong size when I open the document.\n \n// create drawing\n$drawing = new PHPExcel_Worksheet_Drawing();\n$drawing->setName('Logo');\n$drawing->setDescription('Logo');\n$drawing->setPath('logo.gif');\n$drawing->setCoordinates('A1');\n \n// setting image width and height doesn't seem to work correctly\n//$drawing->setResizeProportional(false);\n//$drawing->setWidthAndHeight(230,70);\n \n// add to worksheet\n$drawing->setWorksheet($this->workbook->getActiveSheet());\n \n// make the row larger to accomodate the image\n$this->workbook->getActiveSheet()->getRowDimension(1)->setRowHeight(60);",
