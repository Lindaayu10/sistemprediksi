    "Description": "Hi,\n \nI am using the version 1.6.7 of PHPExcel library in my old PHP application. I've decided to\nupgrade it to 1.7.3c version. Now I have problems with styling cells in the final excel\nresult (document is not styled, same code worked with 1.6.7 version just fine). I did some\nanalysis of my problem and I've found this strangeness. Consider the following code:\n \n$style1 = $this->_templateWorksheet->getStyle('B7'); // red cell background\necho $style1->getHashCode() . '<br>';\n \n$style2 = $this->_templateWorksheet->getStyle('A8'); // yellow cell background\necho $style2->getHashCode() . '<br>';\n \necho $style1->getHashCode() . '<br>';\ndie();\n \nCode results into IMHO incorrect output. Shouldn't the last line with hash be the same\nas the first one? Second call of getStyle() method changes the result of its previous\ncall. IMHO it's not OK. \n \n2b5dc24be450ff51362178050a29c950\ne0bac84a45624bf9299b37fae9ce48e6\ne0bac84a45624bf9299b37fae9ce48e6\n \nIs this a bug in the library? Can you please help me? \n \nBig thanks,\nMichal Wirth",

      "Message": "Hi\r\n\r\nSame problem here with version 1.7.6. I came to the same conclusion, in my case I have a xlsx file that works as a template, that I use to create other xlsx files with different data but with the same layout and style. The problem occurs when I call getStyle method, the last call overrides the value of the previous style even in a diferrent cell. I will try version 1.6.7 to see if the error persists.\r\n\r\nAny one knows if this is a bug or a intended behaviour? it does not make sense to me.",
