    "Description": "I attempted to apply a style to a cell reference that consisted only of a row letter (that is, instead of 'E1', I used just 'E' hoping that the style would apply to all of column 'E').  This code finished without error and the spreadsheet was created, but Excel 2007 claimed it was damaged and needed to be recovered.  The style did not apply as desired.",
