    "Description": "Hiya, if you create an excel file in ms excel 2003, set a bunch of styles on various cells (see attached example) then run:\n \n<?php\n        require_once 'PHPExcel/IOFactory.php';\n        \n        $reader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel5');\n        $xls = $reader->load('/tmp/example_template.xls');\n \n        $writer = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($xls, 'Excel5');\n        $writer->save('/tmp/example_out.xls');\n?>\nWhen opening in excel you find the output is \"corrupt\".. Excel reads all the data but drops all the styles after displaying the error message.\n \nI'm developing in PHP 5.2.4 -2 using Ubuntu server 8.04\n \nThe file saves fine in Excel2007 format, but I really need Excel5 format.",

      "Message": "Hi Koyama-san,\r\n\r\nI've having an exact same problem as this one reported. The strange thing is the problem only happens on my customer's Excel 2003 Basic Edition (SP3) running on XP. My problematic spreadsheet looks very similar to \"40000002_failed_20090603150959.xls\" and it doesn't contain any complex stuff. All it does is to populate value with some styles (bod, font size, draw an underline etc). Spreadsheet opens fine on other computers which has 2003 Pro Ed or 2007. Recently we found an interesting fact which might be related to this problem is that in the attached xls file, if I add one more column before column 'P' (hence old col 'P' becomes 'Q') This \"Damage to the file...\" error causes all format (font size, bold etc) disappear after repair. (Before adding column, even this error arises, format was kept after auto-repair) Can you please take a look this issue again when you get a chance? (using 1.6.7 btw)",

According to \"OpenOffice.org's Documentation of the Microsoft Compound Document File Format\" section 4.1, the \"Compound Document Header Contents\" contains at offset 64 (0x40) the total number of sectors used for the short-sector allocation table, but PEAR::OLE always writes 1.\r\n\r\nThe attached file \"40000002_failed_20090603150959.xls\" is indeed corrupt when opened in MS Office Excel in Windows 7.
