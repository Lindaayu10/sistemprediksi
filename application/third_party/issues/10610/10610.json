    "Description": "Hi, and thx for that impressive project :)\n \nI know it's almost nothing, but why don't you add a method which takes a worksheets array, and add them into the PHPExcel object ?\nSomething like that, maybe.\n \n/**\n  * Add sheets\n  *\n  * @param array(PHPExcel_Worksheet) $pSheets\n  * @throws Exception\n  */\nfunction addSheets($pSheets=null) {\n \tif(is_null($pSheets)) {\n  \t\tthrow new Exception(\"Sheets array is null.\");\n \t}\n \telse {\n  \t\tforeach($pSheets as $sheet) {\n   \t\t\t$this->addSheet($sheet);\n  \t\t}\n \t}\n}\n \nSorry if I'm making a mistake by posting this here ^^'",

      "Message": "Sounds like it may be useful, but we need to be careful. We have had the problem with the addSheet() and addExternalSheet() methods that users (understandably) found it difficult that one should one method for adding internal, or orphan sheets and another for adding external sheets from another workbook.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that addSheet(), addExternalSheet(), and addSheets() are concepts that don't really exist in Excel. On the other hand, createSheet() makes sense. It appends a sheet and at the same time automatically assigns a title.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should instead focus on introducing methods roughly like\r\n\r\n$objPHPExcel->copySheets($array, PHPExcel $destination), or\r\n$objPHPExcel->moveSheets($array, PHPExcel $destination)\r\n\r\nfor copying/moving sheets internally or externally? Concepts which are directly mapped to well-known user functionality in MS Office Excel.",

      "Message": "Well, actually, I create all my orphan sheets into an array, $sheets, and then I add them, one by one, with a foreach.\r\n\r\nI guess you can't copy or move orphan sheets with your methods ?\r\nI wasn't thinking about that implementation, but it's interesting too (maybe more interesting than addSheets() :p)\r\n\r\n\r\nN.B : addSheets() is not to fix a problem, it could just help a little some developpers to save few seconds and 2 lines ^^'",

      "Message": "Ok, I see. In that case my answer is that orphan sheets are dangerous. This concept does not exist in Excel and can give problems if one is not careful. I advice you to use $objPHPExcel->createSheet() instead. Even if it takes a few more lines of code.\r\n\r\nIn the next release of PHPExcel it will be included in the documentation how to add sheets. We had forgotten that until now :-)",
