    "Description": "I am currently trying to put hypertext links in my excel files. In my code I try directly to put the formula [ =LIEN_HYPERTEXTE(\"http://website.com\";\"xxxx\")' ] (which is the french equivalent of \"Hyperlink\") , which gives :\n \n$link = '=LIEN_HYPERTEXTE(\"'.$url.'\";\"'.$text.'\")';\n$sheet->setCellValueByColumnAndRow(2, $x, $link); //Where $x is a variable corresponding to the number line.\n \nWhen I generate my Excel file (.xlsx) with my program, if I try to open it, Excel tells me that the file is not well formated or that its extension is not valid. Do you have any idea, where does this problem come from ?\n \nThanks in advance, \n \nRaphaël",
