    "Description": "I have been using the Excel5 .xls fileformat for weeks but after updating to the latest version of PHPExcel it started complaining about \"Invalid cell coordinate XFD10485768\". I have been using PHPExcel in the way that I have templates that I load and fill with data. What could be the problem? Saving as Excel2007 .xlsx works fine. But customers I'm gonna send the file to won't be able to open the xlsx files.",

      "Message": "The problem is likely related to a row or column reference that isn't being set correctly by PHPExcel, but it isn't easy to identify which (or why) without more specifics. \r\nXFD10485768 is the maximum bottom-right cell in an Excel2007 worksheet. Code that tries to assign maximums will normally use the getHighestColumn() and getHighestRow() values where it need to convert a row or column reference to an actual range of cells, only defaulting to the XFD and 10485768 maximums if the highest column or row is malformed.\r\nIt suggests that something in one of the templates may be malformed, or being misread by the Reader; but without anything specific to work with, it's hard to say. Would it be possible for you to upload one of your templates?",
