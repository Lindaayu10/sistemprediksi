    "Description": "Hi All, \n\nI just downloaded PHPExcel 1.7.8 and tried to use it to read data from the attached excel file.\nIn the file, the whole column B is formatted as \"0######\"\nIt is supposed to read 0225614 when using getFormattedValue() method. However, it only reads 225614.\n\nAm i using the wrong method? How can i get the custom-formatted value correctly?\n\nThanks in advance!",
