    "Description": "Hi everyone, \nI'm facing the following problem and I really wish someone will be able to help me:\n\nI have a .XLS file which is detected as \"CSV\" while it should be seen as a \"Excel5\"... \nWhat could it be? \nThe file can't be edited because it's automatically generated, but in the properties it's identified as \"Microsoft Excel 97-2004\" and its extension is actually XLS.\n\nI've tried many things, read everywhere on the web. Nothing! I have no clue! \nCan somebody help me? \n\nThank you very much!\nBye!",
