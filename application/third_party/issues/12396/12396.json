    "Description": "I am just starting to try out PHPExcel 1.7.2.  Reading a fairly large multi-sheet xlsx file, I ran into this error message.  It spewed out a large number of times.\n_raiseFormulaError message is Formula Error: An unexpected error occured\n \nAfter rummaging around a bit in Calculation.php, I found the exception was being raised in line 2485.  I put a traceback in the _raiseFormulaError function and found this was the offending element:\n IF(ISBLANK($B2),\"\",MAX($A$3:$A#REF!))\n \nThis is obviously triggered by a bad'un in the original file.  Despite the caveat you have in the comments, I thought this was a good enough lead to a problem that you might want to see it. :)\n \nI can provide additional info if you want it.  The test program I am running is a copy of 07reader.php from the non-pear package, modified to use the PEAR installed libraries, and to use an arbitrary input file.",
