    "Description": "XLSX file generated by PHPExcel causes Excel2007 to crash when you try to do print preview, print or save as PDF. You can workaround the issue by opening the file, saving it (size increases slightly), CLOSING Excel, opening the file again and yep, it works!\n \nEven the simplest 01sample.xlsx from Examples wiki page causes this.\n \nAfter some time of tweaking XLSX inner structure and comparing generated and by-Excel-saved file (I'm not XLSX expert) I have discovered that the cause is lack of bookViews element and its subelements in workbook.xml file. When I add these elements from Excel-saved file (<bookViews><workbookView xWindow=\"240\" yWindow=\"540\" windowWidth=\"24615\" windowHeight=\"13485\"/></bookViews>) it works. When I uncomment _writeBookViews in Workbook.php (writes different attributes) it also works.\n \nThe question is - why is _writeBookViews commented out?",
