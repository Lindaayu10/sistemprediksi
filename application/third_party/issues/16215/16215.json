    "Description": "Problem : Excel found unreadable content in 'text.xlsx'. Do you want to recover the contents of this workbook? If you trust the source of this workbook, click Yes.\n \nI'm using this phpexcel version 1.7.6 with LAMP environment having php version 5.2.17 and php_zip version 1.8.11.\n \nI'm writing xlsx document with around 30 sheets. I get the proper excel file with one recovered sheet and If I regenerate the file with some sheet data skipped, it works fine. I've also noticed that the there is no sheet data at fault as I've checked this with alternate sheets as well. Open Office Reports no such error in same scenario whereas MS Office is having some problem in handling large data.\n \nkindly assist and add your valuable inputs on it.\n \nManish",
