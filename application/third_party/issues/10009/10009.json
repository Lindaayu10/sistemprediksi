The ideal situation would probably be to have it so one could control borders via $objWorksheet->setPrintGridlines(true/false).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the underlying TCPDF is a bit limited when it comes to borders. We will fix for borders in PHPExcel_Writer_PDF once this gets fixed for TCPDF:\r\nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2747689&group_id=128076&atid=710535\r\n",
