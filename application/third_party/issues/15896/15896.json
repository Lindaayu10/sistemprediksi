    "Description": "Hi all,\n \nI've got a strange problem. I have a report generated from PHPExcel. When I open it in Excel or OpenOffice everthing is fine.\nUnder iOS 4.3 (iPad) I have numbers missing. I had setPreCalculateFormulas to true, because setting it to false made it worse.\n \nI attached an iamge which shows the same column. First one is the column from Excel 2007 the second one from the iPad.\n \nI've got not a clue how to debug this issue - what could be wrong? Does anyone has the same problem?",
