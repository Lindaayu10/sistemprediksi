    "Description": "Hi all,\n\nI hope this message finds you well.\n\nIs it possible for the project to rename all class files to .class.php, please? At the moment, anybody smart enough can goto http://example.com/Classes/PHPExcel.php and get nothing, really... But it shows that PHPExcel is installed.\n\nIf class files were renamed .class.php, one could setup a rule in the web server to not serve anything called *.class.php. Similar for include files: call them .inc.php and generate a rule to not serve these files.\n\nOf course, one could stop serving from the Classes directory, but maybe somebody wants to have a verification file in there that can be called from a certain IP address only... so not serving the directory is not an option...\n\nAlso, it makes it easier to see on the outside what is inside a file: if it's called .class.php, it probably is a class :)\n\nThanks for considering,\nGuus",

PHPExcel is simply a library it's up to individual users to protect the code if they feel the need to do this, whether by using .htaccess files (or equivalents on different webservers) or by storing the library outside of the public web directories. Simply renaming every file will not protect the code any better, simply obfuscate the filenames (fractionally).",
