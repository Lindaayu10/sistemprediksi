    "Description": "This is more or less a feature request to expand the drawing capabilities of PHPExcel. I don't need all of Excels drawing features, but being able to add rectangular shapes and to put rich text inside those shapes would help in a lot of situations. I'd assume that a lot of code for this could be reused from the already existing work concerning comments and drawings.",
