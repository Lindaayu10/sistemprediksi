    "Description": "When merging cells in the same row as a row set to auto height (i.e. $objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getRowDimension('10)->setRowHeight(-1); ) the auto height setting is disabled or the row height somehow returns to the default row height.\n\nMerging cells first and then setting row height has no effect on row height.\n\nMerging cells after setting the row height returns the row height to some default.",

I can't tell because the description in 18474 is so cluttered with what looks like un processed html tags that I can't make sense of it.\r\n\r\nOnce the fix has been made I will most likely upgrade to that version.",
