If there are permissions issues a notification occurs on the screen that the file could not be written because the Zip file could not be closed or something like that (this also happened to me, but this problem was solved).\r\n\r\nFor the second file: If I, after the warning by Excel, tell Excel to open it anyway it looks fine. I also don't see anything obviously wrong.\r\n\r\nBy the \"built-in php ZipArchive\", I do mean PHP's ziparchive class (the default). The first file was generated using this ZipArchive. The second file was generated using PCLZip. So I already tried both and both give problems, although the file generated using PCLZip can be opened (with warning).",
