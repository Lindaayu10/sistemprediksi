      "Message": "Fixed in SVN.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that Excel5 reader was completely ignoring when an absolute flag was set for the row/column index in the case of cell range addresses. Column/row indexes were always read as relative to the base cell for the shared formula. This explains the error.",
