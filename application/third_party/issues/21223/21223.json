    "Description": "I have a spreadsheet, created through PHPExcel using the .xls format.\n\nWhen I load and save this spreadsheet as .xlsx, it duplicates the data in the shipping and billing address columns like so:\n\nname\naddress\nstate\n\nand when I load and save the file with the code below it becomes\n\nname\naddress\nstatename\naddress\nstate\n\nThis is how I'm loading and saving it:\n\n$spreadsheet = PHPExcel_IOFactory::load($path);\n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($spreadsheet, 'Excel2007');\n$objWriter->save($path);\n\nI'm creating the spreadsheet programatically, and when I save the data using the xlsx format, it also duplicates the data. To repeat differently, if I create the data array and save it directly as an xlsx file, it also duplicates the data.\n\nI'm using the Drupal module PHPexcel https://www.drupal.org/project/phpexcel to generate the file, which means that I'd have to post large chunks of the module code to show how the file is being generated, because I'm using the function phpexcel_export().\n\nHowever, I'm loading the file directly using PHPExcel.\n\nAttached is the file, with sensitive information stripped (I'm generating the contents programatically with dummy data).\n\nWorkaround: Save to .xls and don't convert to .xlsx.\n\nOriginal StackOverflow thread: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25270971/phpexcel-duplicating-cell-data-within-cell",
