    "Description": "Is there a method to force the recalculation of an entire worksheet?  I've been through all of the documentation and haven't found anything.\n\nWhat appears to be my issue, is I have a very complex worksheet that has 5 'input' values.  Changing one value (when running stand alone Excel) recalculates the spreadsheet, which dynamically creates some lookup tables (range of cells) and recalculates some other cells.\n\nWhen I initially load the file with the default inputs, I can read everything ok, even the calculated cells with getCalculatedValue().  However, if I change one of the inputs and try to read a calculated cell, I get a #Value returned.  It appears this is because the worksheet hasn't been recalculated, so some of the dynamically created range of cells are missing.\n\nThanks for the help.",
