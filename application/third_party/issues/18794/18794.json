    "Description": "There is a substantial issue with trying to automatically determine file types.\n\nHow to reproduce:\n1. Create a valid CSV file (quoted values, comma-separated)\n2. Upload that file through a form so that it is available to PHP (we'll call the file array $file)\n3. Call PHPExcel_IOFactory::identify($file['tmp_name']);\n4. The file is identified as 'HTML' instead of 'CSV'\n\nIt seems that the only requirement for hitting this issue is that the file's tmp_name has no extension, and thus skips the first section and starts iterating through readers checking if they can read the file. The HTML reader must be checked before the CSV reader, but the file contains no HTML and it seems like it really should be identified as a CSV.",
