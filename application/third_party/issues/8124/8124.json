      "Message": "Please note that this is only an implement of initial work for the OFFSET Lookup/Reference Function (returning address rather than value at address), so for the moment it's only experimental.\r\n\r\nHowever, there appears to be an issue with passing the cell reference into the function... a while back, I modified some of the logic in the PHPExcel_Calculation class so that it would always pass cell values to the function logic as an array, indexed by the cell row and column. In some cases, it doesn't seem to be doing this, but is passing in the cell value as a string. I've identified most of these circumstances, and made a few changes to ensure that cell values are being passed in correctly; but I need to confirm that I've caught all the exceptions, and that there's not going to be any adverse effects with other functions.\r\n",
