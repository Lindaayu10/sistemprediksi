    "Description": "Issue discovered in this thread:\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=40882\n \nSymptom:\n----\nReading of a valid xls file may fail throwing following exception:\n\"Excel file is corrupt. Didn't find CONTINUE record while reading shared strings\"\n \nThis happens only for BIFF8 files. The chance that this happens increases with the number of Rich-Text strings.\n \nWhy this is happening?\n----\nThis is an inherited bug from SourceForge PHP Excel-Reader which PHPExcel_Reader_Excel5 is built from.  No exception is thrown with the SourceForge PHP Excel-Reader, instead strings are only read until a certain point in the SST (Shared Strings Table).\n \nNo bug report found for the SourceForge PHP Excel-Reader.\n \nWhile SourceForge PHP Excel-Reader does attempt to deal with a SST that is split using CONTINUE records, it only treats the splits correctly when the Unicode string is split within the character array.\n \nIf the Unicode string is instead split after the character array within the list of Rich-Text formatting runs or withing the Asian Phonetic Settings block, then reading will fail.\n \nTest:\n----\nThis has been tested with sample file saved from MS Excel 2008 / 12.0 for Mac, as Excel 97-2004 Workbook, received from original poster. It contained 12 sheets with a total of 997 shared strings.\n \nEnvironment:\n----\nPHPExcel: Latest source from SVN (1.6.4)",
