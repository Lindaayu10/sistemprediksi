    "Description": "The method getFormattedValue() does not return the date value in the same format as excel when the spreadsheet is opened.\n\nExcel shows dates formatted as m/d/yyyy but method above shows date formatted as mm-dd-yy.\n\nThis of course is causing the PHP date function to misinterpret the date.\n\nAnother bit of information I was able to glean is that when I pull the getStyle->getNumberFormat()->getFormatCode() from the file it does return mm-dd-yy format code.\n\nNot sure why Excel is showing the date values as m/d/yyyy instead.\n\nI'm changing my code to use the raw seconds value and format to what I need for import when the seconds value is available, but this won't solve the problem of the display difference between what Excel shows and what getFormattedValue() method returns.\n\nI suspect that the xlsx file is somehow malformed such that excel isn't recognizing the format code that the getFormattedValue() method is pulling out of the file. But that is just a wild guess on my part.\n\nChristopher Mullins",
