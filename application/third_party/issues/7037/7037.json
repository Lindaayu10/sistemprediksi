    "Description": "Hi,\nI downloaded the 1.62 release in Linux and had a small problem with the CSV.php modules. PHPExcel tries to load csv.php but the modules in Reader/\nand Writer/ are named CSV.php. This was easily fixed by 'cp CSV.php csv.php'. \nI noticed a dramatic decrease of memory usage. Unloading a very complex excel in vs 1.60 used about 500M, in 1.62 usage is about 80M :D",

Do not even try to think, jump to conclusions and doing very stupid fixes for noexisting problems.\r\nAs I pointed out Linux is case sensitive so spelling with right casing is important.\r\nThank you very much for pointing at the problem, I do not want to send any code, it is embarrasing enough as it is.\r\nSorry for bothering you ",
