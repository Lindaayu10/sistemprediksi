      "Message": "I've clicked both links above as I am also having this issue. An endless number of Google searches led me to this solution:\r\n\r\nheader('Pragma: ');\r\n\r\nMake sure the above header statement exists along with the others in the PHPExcel documentation (notable Content-Type and Content-Disposition) and IE will stop bothering you. My server setup (PHP 5.3.2, Zend Framework 1.10.x, Apache 2.2.x) defaults Pragma to no-cache, which causes issues when IE tries to open files from my secure website.\r\n\r\nGo to Fiddler2.com for a utility that shows with which headers your site is responding so you can figure out what needs to be fixed (if the Pragma trick above didn't do it).",
