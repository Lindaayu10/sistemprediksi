    "Description": "I am building spreadsheets from scratch - no input. I am building multiple images (png charts) into a workbook (multiple worksheets) along with some calculations .  When I generate the output as Excel 2007, everything is as it should be.  However if I generate the output as excel5 using the exact same code except for the code change for generation target, the images are placed in the wrong locations.  The last image generated on a worksheet is swapped with the first image generated.  To be specific I place a logo image on the worksheet first, then 2 charts generated by jp-graph.  The result in excel5 output is the logo image is swapped with the 2nd chart and the 1st chart is as it should be.  This happens consistently across the 5 or so worksheets I produce.  On one worksheet I generate the logo and 3 charts.  In that case the logo image is swapped with the third chart and the first 2 charts are as they should be.  When I try changing the order of the generation - ie generation of the logo last , the charts get swapped across worksheets.   This is a problem for me because I need to be able to generate the workbook in either excel5 or excel2007 base upon user need.",

      "Message": "The below is code that will show an example of the problem - I patched code together so this wouldn't get too large.  By changing code comments it can generate either excel2007 or excel5 output - the excel2007 output is how the data should look.  The result of this is not exactly the same as what happens when I use my full set of code but it does show that there is some sort of problem.  See readme.txt in zip file ",

Now fixed using custom imagecreatefrombmp():\r\nhttp://www.php.net/manual/en/function.imagecreatefromwbmp.php#86214\r\n\r\nExcel5 writer will convert BMP to PNG prior to writing. May I advice you to use PNG instead of BMP whenever possible. This will speed up writing a bit.\r\n\r\nDownload latest source code tomorrow:\r\nhttp://phpexcel.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets",
