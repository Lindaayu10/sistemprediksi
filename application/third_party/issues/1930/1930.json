    "Description": "We would love to have basic support for ODF 'Calc' file format, the spreadsheet engine file format supported in OpenOffice.org. At first, we would like to be able to write a Calc spreadsheet from PHPExcel. If time permits, a basic reader implementation is also on our wish list.\n* [url:More on ODF...|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument]\n* [url:File format documentation|http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office]",

Need to be able to take all the xls/xlsx stuff and get out CSV or ODS formats. I am trying to get all clients to send only open source formats or CSV at minimum over any other format. ",

Next step is to work on cell styles and value formatting (so far, only date/time is set), which hopefully will make it more useful.\r\n\r\n>> Writer support would be great too.\r\nA writer will come in time. It's not at the top of my \"to do\" list (Charts holds pride of place there); but it's been something that I've wanted myself since I first got involved with the PHPExcel project... and I'm finally getting round to it.",

But no still no writer class has been implemented.\r\n\r\nIf you don't mind me saying, this project seems to be moving rather slowly.\r\n\r\nWhat solution do other people adopt when wanting to export to OOCalc?  Do they simply export to XLSX, and let the Open Office application figure out how to change the format to .ODS?",

Expecting one person to fulfil everyone's demands on an Open Source project is possibly expecting too much of that one person\r\n\r\nOf course, there's nothing to stop other people writing their own readers/writers... perhaps even contributing them back to the project. That's one of the key benefits of Open source, and you even have IReader and IWriter interfaces definitions provided. Trying to draw other collaborators to the project is part of the reason the source has been moved over to github.",
