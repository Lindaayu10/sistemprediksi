    "Description": "Phpexcel sometimes incorrectly calculates values when using absolute rows.\n\nIn the attached example you see that phpexcel does not respect the absolute $ indicator and therefor calculates incorrect values.\n\nA demo script and sheet are attached. This is the output of the script:\n\nB10           =SUM(B6:B9)      91.000      91.000          OK\nC10    =($K10-$B10)/9+B10      88.222      88.222          OK\nE10    =($K10-$D10)/9+D10      83.558      82.667       ERROR\nF10    =($K10-$E10)/9+E10      81.607      79.889       ERROR\nG10    =($K10-$F10)/9+F10      79.873      77.111       ERROR\nH10    =($K10-$G10)/9+G10      78.332      74.333       ERROR\nI10    =($K10-$H10)/9+H10      76.962      71.556       ERROR\nK10           =SUM(K6:K9)      66.000      66.000          OK",
