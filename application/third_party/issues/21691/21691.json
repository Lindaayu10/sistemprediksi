    "Description": "Hey guys,\n\nI was trying to build a pie chart for the 2010 version of Excel but I was struggling on selecting the data to build it.\n\nWhat I wanted to plot was a pie chart with the following formula:\n\n    =SERIES(\n        Worksheet!$F$2;\n        (Worksheet!$K$5;Worksheet!$K$10);\n        (Worksheet!$M$5;Worksheet!$M$10);\n        1\n    )\n\nTo do so, I wrote the following code:\n\n    $labels = array(\n\tnew PHPExcel_Chart_DataSeriesValues('String', 'Worksheet!$F$2', NULL, 1),\n    );\n\n    $xAxis = array(\n\tnew PHPExcel_Chart_DataSeriesValues('String', '(Worksheet!$K$5 ; Worksheet!$K$10)', NULL, 2), \n    );\n\n    $values = array(\n\tnew PHPExcel_Chart_DataSeriesValues('String', '(Worksheet!$M$5 ; Worksheet!$M$10)', NULL, 2), \n    );\n\n    $series = new PHPExcel_Chart_DataSeries(\n\tPHPExcel_Chart_DataSeries::TYPE_PIECHART,\t\t\t\t// plotType\n\tPHPExcel_Chart_DataSeries::GROUPING_STANDARD,\t\t\t// plotGrouping\n\trange(0, count($dataSeriesValues1)-1),\t\t\t\t\t// plotOrder\n\t$labels,\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// plotLabel\n\t$xAxis,\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// plotCategory\n\t$values\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// plotValues\n    );\n\n    [...]\n\nThe problem is, if I don't put a semicolon into the second argument of the function _PHPExcel_Chart_DataSeriesValues()_, it works perfectly but as soon as I add it to the string, it returns me an error:\n\n    Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PHPExcel_Calculation_Exception' with message 'undefined variable ';''\n\nThe thing is: I do need to put the semicolon to get to add different cells in my worksheet. Anyone would know how could I solve this problem?",
