    "Description": "This is an inherited bug from PEAR Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer which PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 is based on.\n \nNo bug report found at the PEAR site.\n \nWe illustrate the bug by doing a plain read/write of a workbook with an image laid over some non-visible columns and rows. Some are non-visible because they are set to hidden, some because they are collapsed in an outline group.\n \nTest (plain read/write):\n----\n$reader = new PHPExcel_Reader_Excel2007();\n$excel = $reader->load('read.xlsx');\n \n$writer = new PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5($excel);\n$writer->save('write.xls');\n \nExpected result:\n----\nxls output is identical to xlsx input when viewed in MS Office Excel 2007\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/3826/readdi8.jpg\n \nAcutal result:\n----\nImage in xls output is squeezed in height because PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 is calculating the position of the bottom-right anchor for the image as if the non-visible rows were visible.\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/8326/writewq7.jpg\n \nEnvironment:\n----\nPHPExcel 1.6.5 (and latest source from SVN)",
