    "Description": "I would like to create Excel files that can be opened with \"ordinary\" Excel 2003 (standard installation, no compatibility pack).\n \nTherefore I tried using PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 to generate an XLS file, but when I open the file in Excel 2007 I first get the following alert box:\n \n\"File Error: data may have been lost.\"\n \nNote that this happens even for \"blank\" spreadsheets. After clicking \"OK\" I see no problems with the file, though.\n \nThe same behavior is seen in Excel 2003 SP3. Before upgrading Microsoft Office 2003 with service pack 3 there was no such problem.\n \nOthers seem to have similar problems with other packages (perhaps similar code)\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/spreadsheet-writeexcel/browse_thread/thread/6656856820b6f799/\n \nFrom what I read, the problem is that Excel 2007 is no longer compatible with Excel 95 spreadsheets, but only with Excel 97 spreadsheets and up. Same is the case for  Excel 2003 with SP3.\n \nUnfortunately, this makes PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 much less useful.\n \nIs there a workaround to this problem? I wouldn't mind sacrificing Excel 95 support.",

A ZIP file is attached with the results for the test run of the 3 examples mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that done using the latest PHPExcel 1.5.5. I also did a single test with the snapshot (Change set 8954) yielding a similar result.",
