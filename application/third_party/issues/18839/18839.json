More recent versions of PHPExcel than 1.7.6 reduce the memory overhead slightly, and also offer additional caching options including SQLite &#40;which is highly efficient in terms of memory usage&#41;",

    "Description": "Hi,\n\nI am trying to create a PHP Excel file and everything works fine until the data increases and goes beyond 5000 rows and I start getting memory exhausted error. I have tried all caching methods and increasing the memory limit. We are using version 1.7.6. We are using styles, validations, etc. \n\nCan anyone help me with this? This is quiet urgent as the site is already live and users are complaining of the same.\n\nThanks,\nAnil Gupta",
