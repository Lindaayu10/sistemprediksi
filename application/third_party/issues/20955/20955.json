    "Description": "I have an excel sheet, which you can find in the attachments, that has some validations (mainly drop down validations list). I have to edit this excel sheet and then submit it. when I create a reader and the load the excel file for editing through reader and load functions of PHPExcel, respectively, I found all the validation are vanished from the excel sheet.\n\n$filename = \"Sport.xlsx\";\n$filepath = Configure::read('DIR_FS_PLAY_FEED') . \"Sport.xlsx\";\n$fileType = 'Excel2007';\n$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader($fileType);       \n$objPHPExcel = PHPExcel_IOFactory::load('../tmp/dir/Sport.xlsx'); \n\nNow I can enter any value in the excel sheet because there is no validation. this is wrong and not accepted by the system. I can't put the custom validation through get/setDatavalidation() functions of PHPExcel because this doesn't allow by my project.\nMy project requirement is to preserve the validations that are previously existed in sheet while editing not to built your own validation.\nTell me is there any way to load the excel sheet in such a way so that its validations are preserved.",
