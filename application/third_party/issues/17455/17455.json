    "Description": "In the latest version of PHPExcel (1.7.6), the one decimal number format is not respected. I have a dutch Open Office document with two cells.\nCell 1 has a number format which is set to \"0.0\" and a value of \"21,5\" (note the comma since it is dutch)\nCell 2 has a number format which is set to \"#,##0.0\" and a value of \"21,4\" (note the comma since it is dutch)\n \nThe thousands separator is set to a dot and the decimal separator is set to a comma:\n\\PHPExcel_Shared_String::setDecimalSeparator( ',' );\n\\PHPExcel_Shared_String::setThousandsSeparator( '.' );\n \nThere will be invalid results when calculating the cell value with the following code:\n$formatCode = $excel->getCellXfByIndex( $cell->getXfIndex() )->getNumberFormat()->getFormatCode();\n$value = \\PHPExcel_Style_NumberFormat::toFormattedString( $cell->getCalculatedValue(), $formatCode );\n \nCell 1 will output: \"21.5\" (note the dot)\nCell 2 will output \"21,4\" (note the comma)\n \nThe reason for this is that the function PHPExcel_Style_NumberFormat::toFormattedString does not execute a number_format on the calculated value. On line 677 a check is done for thousands separators. If so, number_format will be used. If not the value is calculated with a sprintf function.\nThe solution would be to rewrite that piece of code so that both cases use the number_format function.",
