    "Description": "Hi!\n\nIm having some problems with trying to collecting the values from some of my cells. \nI want to extract multiple sheets contains both variables and formulas from and .xlsx file and use the logic on a interactive website where the user can change the variables. \nThe problem is that getCalculatedValue() generates errors when parsing the formaulas(See below):\n```\n Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PHPExcel_Exception' with message 'GALLERIAGÅNGAR!G7 -> Formula Error: An unexpected error occured' in C:\\...\\PHPExcel\\Cell.php on line 307\n( ! ) PHPExcel_Exception: GALLERIAGÅNGAR!G7 -> Formula Error: An unexpected error occured in C:\\...\\PHPExcel\\Cell.php on line 307\n```\nWhen debugging I get this information (Formula included (G7 Value) ):\n```\nG7 Value is =IF($E7=\"GALLERIAGÅNGAR\",INDEX(Variabel!$1:$1048576,MATCH($E7,Variabel!$B:$B,0),MATCH(GALLERIAGÅNGAR!G$6,Variabel!$5:$5,0)),\"\")\nParser Stack :-\n\nCALCULATION ENGINE ERROR: GALLERIAGÅNGAR!G7 -> Formula Error: An unexpected error occured\n\nEvaluation Log:\n\nArray\n(\n)\n```\n\nI have read that it could be a problem if Locale is not set properly, since different nationalities have different syntax in Excel. But as far as I know this should be resolved by setting Locale by:\n```\n$locale = 'sv';\nPHPExcel_Settings::setlocale($locale);\n```\nI have a temporary solution right now where I use getOldCalculatedValue() instead when an exception is thrown from getCalculatedValue(). But this will not be a working solution since I want to be able to make changes.\nI have not written the formulas in the .xlsx myself but they are working very well in Excel. \nFormulae:\n```\n=IF($E7=\"GALLERIAGÅNGAR\";INDEX(Variabel!$1:$1048576;MATCH($E7;Variabel!$B:$B;0);MATCH(GALLERIAGÅNGAR!G$6;Variabel!$5:$5;0));\"\")\n```\n\nIm totally stuck here so any help would be much apprieciated!",
