    "Description": "When creating a sheet with more than 260 columns, the outputted fields overwite those in earliers columns; i.e. MA1 becomes A1. This is because the preg_match on row 376 in PHPExcel/Cell.php doesn't allow for higher column numbers. According to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa730921.aspx, Excel 2007 accepts columns up to 16,384 (XFD).",

      "Message": "I forgot to say: This affects CSV and Excel5 as well. When the preg_match (which is in the coordinateFromString function BTW) is changed (I changed it to allow up to ZZ, since that seemed to be enough for me), the saving of CSV, Excel and Excel2007 works well, save for the fact that the columns beyond IV in Excel5 are lost (since the format doesn't accept it).",
