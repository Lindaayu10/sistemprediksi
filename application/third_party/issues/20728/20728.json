    "Description": "Hello,\n\nI am using PHPExcel version 1.7.9 and it works great. I am using Google Chrome version 33.0.xx and now I have the issue that all the Excel documents generated through the application in this browser contain a space (hex 20) at the beginning of the generated file. It is not doing this with Internet Explorer, Safari and Firefox. Only Google Chrome. So possibly it is not directly a bug in PHPExcel, but maybe you have some advise or experience with this behaviour.\n\nJohan\nGermany",

There exists both UTF8 with signature and without signature (so its called in my IDE). With signature caused it to fail.\r\n\r\nOne other solution that I found regarding this is to use: ob_clean_end(); before you start to output the data to the browser. This will clean the output buffer in php. ",
