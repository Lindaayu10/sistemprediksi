    "Description": "We work on windows to develop our web application. Before deploying to production we deploy the application on a test server, which is Linux (ubuntu) \nand which is the same configuration as the production server.\n \nSince there is a bug in php 5.2.6 with the scientific notation we had to switch to php 5.2.8.\n \nWe tested our excel generations and we noticed that the generation of Excel2007 does not work on windows. It generates a corrupt file. However it works perfectly on our test (linux) server.\n \nGeneration of an Excel5 does work perfectly on windows though.\n \nI made my test based on the 01simple.php file. You can find them in the zip file.\n \nI made 4 tests:\n \n  1) FAILS: generating an excel 2007 and output it to the clients browser\n  2) FAILS: generating an excel 2007 and save it\n  3) WORKS: generating an excel5 and output it to the clients browser\n  4) WORKS: generating an excel5 and save it\n \nDev Environment =\n===================\nWampServer Version 2.0f\nphp 5.2.8\napache 2.2.11",
