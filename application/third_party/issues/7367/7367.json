    "Description": "I'm not sure if it is intentional that the above function returns values depending on local timezone settings on the server.\n \nTest run for 1970-01-01 00:00:00 (= 25569 in Excel 1900-based datetime)\n \n// this gives 0 which is ok\nvar_dump(PHPExcel_Shared_Date::ExcelToPHP(25569));\n \n// this gives 25569.0416666667 because I have GMT+1 where I am (but I was still expecting to get back 25569)\nvar_dump(PHPExcel_Shared_Date::PHPToExcel(0));\n \nReason seems to be because the PHP date() function depends on time zone:\nhttp://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php#85110\n \nI'm asking because I would like to use some of those functions to implement date handling in Excel5 reader.\n \nIs the above behavior expected?",

I'll look at modifying the functions in PHPExcel_Shared_Date to do that. I'll also double check all the Excel date/time functions too; I suspect I'll need to do the same with some of those as well.\r\n\r\nI won't be able to make the changes till the beginning of September though... I'm too busy with other (non-computer) activities a the moment.",
