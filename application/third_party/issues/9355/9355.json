    "Description": "Currently, PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 is writing more styles (XF records) than necessary. The way styles are written now they are not shared across sheets. Each sheet refers to its own set of styles.\n \nIn this work item we eliminate duplicate styles. This involves building one global style hash table instead of one style hash table per sheet.\n \nThere will be a slight gain in speed when writing workbooks with many sheets, but only by a few percent. The primary gain from this work item is that it will be easier to implement further enhancements.",
