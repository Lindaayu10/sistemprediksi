    "Description": "This bug seems to occur when PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 writes COLINFO records where the column index is out of boundary for BIFF8 workbook, that is above column 256.\n \nOne may argue that this is actually a bug in the application MS Office Excel 2007.\n \nTest plain read/write:\n----\n$reader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel5');\n$excel = $reader->load('read.xls');\n \n$writer = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($excel, 'Excel5');\n$writer->save('write.xls');\n \n$writer = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($excel, 'Excel2007');\n$writer->save('write.xlsx');\n \nExpected result:\n----\nOutput is identical to input\n \nActual result:\n----\nResult by Excel2007 writer ok\nResult by Excel5 writer not ok, here, when one opens the workbook in MS Office Excel 2007 all the column widths have reverted to default, except for column B. Note the OpenOffice.org 3 shows workbook as expected.\n \nSolution:\n----\nImpose restriction in writer so it only writes COLINFO records within boundary (1 through 256)\n \nEnvironment:\n----\nPHPExcel 1.6.4 (and latest source from SVN)",
