    "Description": "According to Excel specifications, any cell marked as a subtotal should not be taken into account when performing an aggregation calculation over it. I have found that the latest version of PHPExcel (1.8) does this unfortunately. I have found and implemented the proposed fix at https://phpexcel.codeplex.com/workitem/19910# (for 1.7.9), which does work, however it introduces a new bug on certain SUBTOTAL formulas (either when a single cell or a range consisting of one cell is referenced), for example =SUBTOTAL(9,E38,E39:E39). Are there any proposed fixes for this issue? Perhaps someone could have a look at the proposed fix mentioned and look into fixing the bug. I did attempt to fix it myself, but failed...",
