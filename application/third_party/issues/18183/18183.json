    "Description": "There would seem to be an apparent bug in Excel2007 when using a conditional style with horizontal right alignment for a merged cell.  This can be seen by running the attached program, which is a modified version of the conditional formatting program found in the test suite.\nÂ \nThe only way to avoid this bug would be to default off the regular styling for the cell, and only output conditional style sections if they have an explicit value set for them (i.e. the default style for the merged would be horizontal right alignment, and nothing would be put on the conditional style for alignment).",
