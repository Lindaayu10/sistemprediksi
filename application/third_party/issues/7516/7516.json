    "Description": "This issue was discovered in this discussion thread:\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=34927\n \nGenerally, there seems to be problems with Excel2007 reader and conditional styles. After doing some plain read/write tests the conclusion is that conditional styles don't survive a plain read/write. Moreover, when one tries to open the output in MS Office Excel 2007 one finds that xlsx files are broken.\n \nPlease check attachment showing the result of a plain read/write. Conditional style is lost and the output is broken.\n \nCode snippet:\n----\n$reader = new PHPExcel_Reader_Excel2007();\n$PHPExcel = $reader->load('cond.xlsx');\n$writer = new PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007($PHPExcel);\n$writer->save('2007-write.xlsx');\n \nEnvironment:\n----\nPHPExcel: latest source from SVN (1.6.3+)",
