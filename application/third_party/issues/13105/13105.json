    "Description": "This is very easy for you to fix...\n \nI have spent 2 hours trying to work out why my system keeps crashing... it was because I was doing:\n \n               $sheet->setTitle($exptitle);\n \nAnd $exptitle was 50 characters long.\n \nLine by line debugging and testing in excel... finds that setTitle cannot be over 31 characters long.\n \nNow it works as I have got it programmed as:\n \n               $sheet->setTitle(substr($exptitle,0,31));\n \nI wonder if you should put in some form of automatic truncation if the title goes over 31 chars long.\n \nThis will help other people greatly!\n \nTa's a-lot-o...
