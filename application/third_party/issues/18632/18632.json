    "Description": "The ZIP file for 1.7.7 is built incorrectly.  Instead of unarchiving into directories, all the file names have a windows path structure in the file name itself.  For instance:\n \n\"Classes\\PHPExcel\\CachedObjectStorage\\APC.php\"  \n \nThat's not the path, that's the actual file name as it has been unzipped.",
