      "Message": "The problem is in chart reference. When you setTitle, after in Calculation.php is called getSheetByName by old name (which does not exists).\r\n\r\nYour chart has formula (data source) something like Workbook1!$B$3:$B$7 (which stays the same after title change - bug?).\r\n\r\nMy solution was not to use xlsx template. Build your graph in code with PHPExcel_Chart.",
