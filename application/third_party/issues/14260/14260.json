    "Description": "Whenever I try to set cell values with a string of one char the excel that is generated has empty cells.\n \nWith version 1.7.3 everything worked fine: this started to happen when i upgraded from 1.7.3 to 1.7.3c. In 1.7.4 it is still happening.\n \nBelow is a snippet that can reproduce the problem on my machine.\nI also attach the excel created from that script.\n \n<?php\n \nrequire_once './Classes/PHPExcel.php';\nrequire_once './Classes/PHPExcel/IOFactory.php';\n \n$test_values = array( 1 => 'A',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2 => 'B',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3 => 'C',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4 => 'D',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5 => '+',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t6 => '-');\n \n$PHPExcel = new PHPExcel();\n$PHPExcel->setActiveSheetIndex(0);\n \nforeach ($test_values AS $row => $cell_value)\n\t$PHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->setCellValueByColumnAndRow(0, $row, $cell_value);\n\t\nheader('Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel');\nheader('Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=\"singleCharTest.xls\"');\nheader('Cache-Control: max-age=0');\n \n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($PHPExcel, 'Excel5');\n$objWriter->save('php://output');\n \n?>",
