    "Description": "Hello there,\n\nI'm working with the example for pie charts and it doesn't show the legends of the chart. The funny thing is that the example for bar charts works really well.\n\nThe same example, you put it for a pie chart and none legend appears.\n\nI'm using PHP 5.3.8 and Office2010\n\nDo you have any idea why this could be happening? Or do you know how to make the chart shows the legends?\n\nI really appreciate your help.\n\nThanks a lot.",
