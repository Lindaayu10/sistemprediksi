    "Description": "Using PHPExcel to generate a very simple .xls file (Excel5 Writer). Whenever that file is opened on Windows 7 using Excel 2010 or 2007, it gives the following error: \n \n\"Excel found unreadable content in 'XXXXXXX.xls'. Do you want to recover the contents of this workbook? If you trust the source of this workbook, click Yes.\"\n \nWhen the same file is opened in MS Excel 2007 or MS Excel 2010 in Windows XP it works fine. If it is opened in OpenOffice, it works regardless of the OS.\n \nWindows 7 / Excel 2010: Error\nWindows 7 / Excel 2007: Error\nWindows XP / Excel 2010: Works\nWindows XP / Excel 2007: Works\nAny / OpenOffice: Works\n \nMay be related to the following article http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2411912 from MS Support, suggesting that the problem is in PHP_OLE.",

I had it working before I made some formatting changes, specifically the setWidth() and setAutoSize(), I tried using all setAutoSize() it still gave me the error, I tried to use all setWidth() and it still gave me the error.  I then commented all of the setWidth / setAutoSize call out and it no longer gives me the unreadable error...  I will post anything else I find as I start to put some of the calls back in...",

The odd thing is that I can click a link and have it generate and send to the browser the excel file to download but when I have it email me this xlsx file I get the error. I am saving the xlsx file to the server before I email it, and this also gives me the same error. I don't see how it could be caused by the UTF-8 encoding since if I output to the browser it works correctly.
