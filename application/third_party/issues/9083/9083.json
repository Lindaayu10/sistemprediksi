    "Description": "Hey!\n \nI have a problem with reading excel2007 files generated by the writer.\nI get this message: Excel found unreadable content in '*.xlsx'. Do you want to recover the contents of this workbook? If you trust the source of this workbook, click Yes.\n \nI've read through the threads dealing with this problem, among them http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=42854\nbut I haven't gotten it to work.\nI have changed php_zip.dll to the new one recommended in FAQ but the problem remains.\n \nIs there anything else I've forgotten? Can you just paste over the old php_zip.dll and then reload? This I tried.\n \nPreviously had a problem with output from the browser got in to the xlsx but moved the script to another file so now that works anyway.",

      "Message": "My problem was that there was rows echoed into the output. Since used the PHPExcel in the same script as a script that handled some layout. If I viewed the output I got <html> <head> and <body> tags in the output. My tip is to have a form that sends to the PHPExcel-script and let the PHPExcel-script send the output to the browser. Don't have any echoes at all!",
