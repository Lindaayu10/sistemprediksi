    "Description": "I am setting cell value as a formula, which references another sheet in the workbook.\n(\nsomething like;\n='Manufactured Furnace'.D10\n)\nBut when the file's created, and I open it in Excel, I get:\n='manufactured furnace'.D10\nwhich, as you might imagine, results in an error, because it doesn't match.\n \nEven weirder -- in another instance, this;\n='Site-Built Zonal'.D10\nbecome this;\n='Site-built Zonal'.D10\n \nWhy is the case changed? What's the deal here? :-)\n(thanks for reading)",
