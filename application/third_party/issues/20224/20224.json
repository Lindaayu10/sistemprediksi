    "Description": "Hello,\nI have stumbled upon an issue where the writer stops on a field containing a less-than (<) sign.  I have tried escaping this character but other than replacing it with the words \"less than\" nothing works.  I am outputting information from a database and the criteria are listed as ranges, so \"<\" will likely be in at least one of the cells.  Any help would be appreciated.\n\nthanks.",
