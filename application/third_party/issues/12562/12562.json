    "Description": "In Excel, it is possible to define a named formula, (eg Name=\"TestFormula\", Value = \"=1/5\", then to reference that by name within a normal cell formula (eg Cell=\"A1\", Formula = \"=B2+TestFormula\"), which will then allow be calculated as B2+1/5\n \nThis becomes extremely powerful and flexible when combined with some additional functions supported by named formulae that aren't available for normal cell formulae, for example, the EVALUATE() function.\n \n(eg Named formula =\"TestFormula2\", Value = \"=EVALUATE(A1&B1&C1)\"\nif A1 is a numeric \"5\", B1 is a string \"+\" and C1 is a numeric \"10\"\nthen creating a formula in cell E1 of \"=TestFormula2\" will give a calculated value of 15 in cell E1\nchanging the value of B1 to \"/\" will give a calculated value of 0.5 in cell E1\netc",
