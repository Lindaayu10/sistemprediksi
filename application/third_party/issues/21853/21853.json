    "Description": "Hi!\nI am trying to implement PHPexcel to my project but I have minimum knowledge of PHP so this is a little bit hard for me.\nI am trying to get excel content from two sheets (one named sheet 1 and the other sheet 2), convert it and include it in my php file by maintaining the format from excel.\n\nMy code for now looks like:\n<?\nrequire_once 'PHPExcel/IOFactory.php';\n\n$excelFile = \"mySheet.xlsx\";\n\n$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel2007');\n$objPHPExcel = $objReader->load($excelFile);\n\n\nvar_dump($arrayData);\n?>\n\nHow do I call the two sheets by ID by maintaining the format of the two sheets?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you in advance.\nRadu.",
