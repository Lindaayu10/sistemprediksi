    "Description": "I know that SUMPRODUCT is not implemented in PHPExcel internal calculator, but I have no choice, but to use this formula, because I need clients to enter quantity of the product they need and total sum to be calculated. Is there any way to make PHPExcel not to write \"Not implemnted\" value to the cell, so EXCEL can calculate formula by itself?\nI tried $objWriter->setPreCalculateFormulas(false); but that seems to have no effect.\nHere is example Excel file:\nhttp://www.grand-fair.ru/mbk/book_price/626 \nBroken formula is in tel cell K5\nI have to use Exce5 writer, since Excel2007 takes more memory, and I get \"not enough memory\" error on large files",

SUMPRODUCT() is among these functions, so it cannot be read from or written to .xls files.\r\n\r\nI'm also surprised that the Excel2007 Reader/Writer take more memory than Excel5... all my own tests have shown the reverse as the test results in http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/discussions/234150?ProjectName=phpexcel show.\r\n",
