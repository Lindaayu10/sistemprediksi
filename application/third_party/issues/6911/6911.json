    "Description": "I am very happy that PHPExcel supports repeating rows for a worksheet. This allows me to create Excel 2007 documents that are more readable when printed from MS Office Excel 2007.\n \nSince PDF documents are especially useful for the print media, I am now requesting that also the PDF writer treats repeating rows in a similar fashion.\n \nI guess that a similar feature request can be put forward for the support for repeating columns in the PDF writer, but for this to make sense it would be needed to change the behavior of PDF writer so it does not merely truncate the columns exceeding the print area. Therefore, for now, I am only requesting PDF writer to support repeating rows.",

For my current project I simply just want the first 4 rows (containing headers) to repeat on subsequent pages in the PDF.\r\n\r\nHope I understand your question, but I didn't even know that one could specify repeating rows / columns for a non-contiguous range in Excel?",

That is a limitation we must live with for now.",
