    "Description": "Hello to all the developers and contributors of the project. I am trying to build an automated procedure for creating a db table from the first row of each worksheet. I stumbled upon the constant TYPE_NULL on the datatype.php class which strangely has the same value as the constant TYPE_STRING ='s'. I am trying to do some datatype binding for each field and column  of the worksheet, calculate the most common value and tranform this value to the equivalent datatype for the \"create table...\" sql query. Am i going to be on the safe side if i change its value to something more clear like \"nu\" for example? I haven't read all the classes to be honest.",
