    "Description": "From thread:\nhttp://phpexcel.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=53318\n \nWell, I have a problem with generated PDF.. I set column widths with the code below. \n    foreach ($tableProperties['width'] as $param => $value)\n        $objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getColumnDimension($param)->setWidth(($value+0.83));        //+0.83 == offset\n \nIt displays OK in Excel, but in PDF it displays very wider than it should be. I can send xls and pdf files on email. I just don't want to post screenshots with it's content on web. \n \nIs it a known problem? Can you help me? It seems, that PDF's \"width\" is different from Excel one. It's about 2 times wider.",

      "Message": "Maarten, I did a quick test with TCPDF which I do not know very well. But it apparently always treats a CSS width as if it is in points. For example, no matter whether one writes width:100, width:100px, width:100pt, always yields same result. If we switch to points instead of pixels we may get better results.\r\n\r\nAlso, PHPExcel_Shared_Drawing::cellDimensionToPixels can be adjusted to give a lower value that fits better with typical default font size.\r\n\r\nSuggesting patch. Gives better results also with scripts in Tests folder.",
