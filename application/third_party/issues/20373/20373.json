    "Description": "Hello,\n\nI'm currently working on a daemon script (Symfony command) which intented to load records from an xlsx to database and I noticed, after every iteration of:\n\n```\n$objPHPExcel = $this->excel->load($filePath);\n$objPHPExcel->disconnectWorksheets();\nunset($objPHPExcel);\n```\n\nthe memory usage is increased with 100-200Kb depending on the file size.\nIf I leave out these line, the memory usage seems to be stable.\n\nAny advise?\nThanks in advance",
