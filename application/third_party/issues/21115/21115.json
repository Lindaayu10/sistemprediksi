    "Description": "Hello!\n\nWhen i try to import the attached file (image.xls), i have the follow error:\n\"__Fatal error: Call to a member function getBlipType() on a non-object in PHPExcel\\Reader\\Excel5.php on line 919__\"\n\nI've been analyzing the code, and noticed that \"BSE\" object (PHPExcel/Reader/Excel5.php - line 919) can't get the type of index, because the index is not obtained at line 916 ($BSEindex = $spContainer->getOPT(0x0104)). This, in turn, occurs because at Escher class (PHPExcel/Reader/Excel5/Escher.php - line 636 ($this->_object->setOPT($opidOpid, $value))), is not informed the parameter 0x0104 (260), which in turn is referenced at line 916 of the first file Excel5.php, returning null.\n\nI think that, if the picture is not valid, it should be ignored or displayed an error referring her.\n\nThanks!",
