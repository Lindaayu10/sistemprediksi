    "Description": "At the very least for number format, but I think for a number of the other formats.  The no impact formatting is not working properly.\n\n(See https://phpexcel.codeplex.com/discussions/261155 for notes on alignment.)\n\nIn number format, this is because getFormatCode returns _builtInFormatCode before _formatCode. (https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel/blob/b7acf2bbe414b1b02f90188d4cfe4df1943b2f97/Classes/PHPExcel/Style/NumberFormat.php#L258-L268)\n\nSo to fix this _builtInFormatCode must be set to false as well as _formatCode = null.\n\nI'm guessing this same issue applies in the other classes.",
