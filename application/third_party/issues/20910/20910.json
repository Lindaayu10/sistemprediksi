    "Description": "Hello,\n\nI have an Excel file that serves me as a template which I read with PHPExcel, add some data to a new sheet and export again.\n\nSeveral cells in this file have validation set up, one of them set for a date validator. After saving the file, this particular validator fails - if I open the same file in the same Excel and try to open the Data Validator settings for that cell, I get an error message saying \"The selection contains more than one type of validation. Erase current settings and continue?\". This does not happen with the original file.\n\nIf I open the file using LibreOffice, it does see the validation on that cell (though the minimum and maximum values are represented as \"39083\" and \"43081\" respectively, instead of being dates).\n\nI tried to reproduce the problem with a simple Excel file only containing one single cell with data validation, but in that case it worked fine, so I had to attach my full Excel file. The cell in question is J/K4, PHPExcel is 1.7.9/1.8.0, Excel is 2007 SP2 and PHP is PHP 5.4.9-4ubuntu2.4\n\nMinimum code to reproduce the error:\n\n```\n$file = \"tdk_jegyzokonyv_minta_ures.xlsx\";\n$phpExcelObject = PHPExcel_IOFactory::load($file);\n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($phpExcelObject, 'Excel2007');\n$objWriter->save(\"out.xlsx\");\n```\n\nAny ideas or help would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nAdam",
