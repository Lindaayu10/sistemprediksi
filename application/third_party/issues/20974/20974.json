    "Description": "Hi,\n\nI have heard that APCU is backward compatible with APC cache. I am using PHP 5.5, thus it seems the viable caching method for userland. When I set the cache method, having activated apcu in my ini file, it seems to go through and returns true, however, when I call PHPExcel_Settings::getCacheStorageMethod() immediately after i get a value of 'Memory'. Is PHPExcel silently reverting to this?\nRegards. I am using PHPExcel 1.7.9 and PHP 5.5ts on Windows8.",
