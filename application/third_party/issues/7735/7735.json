    "ClosedComment": "Fixed in SVN\n\nDetails:\n----\n1. For some reason the GUTS record was not being written for BIFF8 (Excel 97 - Excel 2003, compatible), but only for \"version 7\" (Excel 5.0 - Excel 95, compatible). After enabling this, the row outline shows, but still not the column outline. (PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 is hard-coded to produce BIFF8 Excel files.)\n\n2. In PEAR Bug #14729, Aleks McFly points to the problem why the column outline is not showing. After fixing this, also the column outline shows.",
