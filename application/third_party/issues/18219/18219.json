    "Description": "The cache is seeded based on the worksheet name - which, unless was explicitly changed by a user, is always the same across spreadsheets. This means that if you are processing several spreadsheets and the same cell coordinates have functions in several of those sheets, the cache will \"always\" (within 15 seconds or so of the cache add) return the results of the first sheet's calculations.\n \n Repro:\n 1. Create 2 spreadsheets\n 2. In both spreadsheets, use the first worksheet (Both should be named something like \"Sheet1\")\n 3. in the first spreadsheet, set A1 to 10. In the second spreadsheet, set A1 to 20\n 4. in the first spreadsheet, set B1 to \"=A1+10\". in the second spreadsheet, set B1 to \"=A1+20\"\n 5. in both spreadsheets, copy the B1 cells down for a bit (20 rows creates a good example)\n 6. use PHPExcel to read the first spreadsheet, print results, then immediately read the second spreadsheet and print the results.\n 7. See that the second spreadsheets results are the same as the first.\n \nAttached is my rejected fix for reference.  Creating this ticket to track the progress of the fix, since i cannot upgrade to a pristine PHPExcel until i know this is fixed.\n \nThanks!",
