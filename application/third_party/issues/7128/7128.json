    "Description": "Hello, thanks for reading.\n \nWell, I created an excel file wtih PHPExcel5 and saved it in a folder. But when I tried to open in my cellphone, the file seems to be protected or with errors, but when I opened it in my PC, it has no problems. If I open the file and save it with another name, and then when I try to open the file in my cellphone, it opens. What can be the problem here??  Thanks a lot.\n \nI attach the file generated, it can be opened by blackberry or iphone.",
