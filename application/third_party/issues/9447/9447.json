    "Description": "When using if statement in formulas it's evaluating the true part and also the false part.\nIt's unnecessary and olso it's not excel works form.\n \nLet's see an example\n \n$objPHPExcel = new PHPExcel();\n \n//first example\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('A1', '=IF(1=2, 1/1, 2)');\necho $objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getCell('A1')->getCalculatedValue(); // 2\n \n//second example\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('B1', '=IF(1=2, 1/0, 1)');\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getCell('B1')->getCalculatedValue()); // #N/A in phpexcel, while excel result is 1\n \n \nI think that the correct calculation should omit the true part because it's unnecesary.\n \nHope this help",

      "Message": "Perhaps surprisingly, it would actually entail more processing to assess the test and only execute the one true/false part: the current parser evaluates all three elements (test, true and false) before determining which result to return.\r\n\r\nI'm currently starting an evaluation of the parser logic to determine whether its performance can be improved, and how it can be modified to handle some of the advanced formulae.\r\nWhile I'm doing that, I'll take a look at this specific case. At the very least, I suspect I'll be better able to trap the divide by zero error, so that the whole IF condition doesn't fail. However, it'snot likely to be in the next release, but might be available by the summer.",
