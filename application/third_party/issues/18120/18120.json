      "Message": "The funnel icon indicates that there is an \"active\" filter on the filter column. Currently PHPExcel does supports setting filterable columns, but doesn't yet support setting an active filter, although it does still recognise the rows hidden by an active filter as hidden. This is on the TO DO list: while creating this feature is fairly straightforward, there is a noticeable performance overhead, and I'd prefer to work out a method of implementing this that doesn't take an excessive time to execute.",
