    "Description": "Hi, \nI'm producing a multi sheet workbook. I open and close the workbook for each sheet.\nIf the first sheet is large the subsequent sheets takes very long time to produce. In this particular case the job bombs out due to memory is exhausted. This happens when I create the sheet assemblies first.\nIn the attached Excel workbook the assemblies sheet is created as the last sheet.",
