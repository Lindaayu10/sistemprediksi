    "Description": "I know it's uncommon, but i happened to have an xlsx file with control char in cell.\nexcel supports control char all the way. but xml 1.0 doesn't support most of control char.\nso when there is a control char in cell, MS use some escape rule to transform them. \nI didn't check Open XML documents, so i'm not sure if there is a rule in the doc.\nI read some PHPExcel code. seems that PHPExcel just use simplexmlloadstring to load the strings in SharedStrings.xml\nThe following is what I tried in excel 2007\ncontrol char 1A => _x001A_\n_x001A_ => _x005F_001A_\n_ => _\n \nmaartenba,\ni will send you a sample xlsx file to your email box:\nm a a r t e n AT p h p e x c e l DOT n e t\n \nplease check it out\nthanks",
