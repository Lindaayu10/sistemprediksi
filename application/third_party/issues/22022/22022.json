    "Description": "I have a project where I take simple sheets created by team members and do some PHP'ing on them and then fill a blank sheet with new info.\nIn one .xlsx file I get an error: \n> Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PHPExcel_Writer_Exception' with message 'File zip:///Users/me/code/files/myfile.xlsx#xl/media/image1.png does not exist' \n\nFound the source of this .png from a stack exchange answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/142356/why-does-numbers-hide-a-huge-png-file-in-exported-excel-sheets\n\nthat says that this .png is a default image fill that excel sometimes inserts on export. \n\nI'm not sure how to fix this. I'm using the PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007 and I don't need the .png but I don't want to have to find and delete and resave files if they contain it. \n\nany help appreciated",
