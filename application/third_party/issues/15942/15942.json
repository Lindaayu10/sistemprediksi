      "Message": "It isn't a bug, Inserting/Removing is actually quite a complex process because it needs to adjust every cell address following the \"before row/column\", and also check and possibly adjust every formula within the worksheet; which could be a lot of cell changes, depending on the size of your worksheet. \r\n\r\nIf you're inserting more than one row or column, make sure you use the $pNumCols/$pNumRows argument, rather than doing all 2000 individually.\r\n\r\nBut I will take a look at whether it might be optimised in some way to speed up the process.",
