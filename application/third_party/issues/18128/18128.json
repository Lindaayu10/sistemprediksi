    "Description": "Hello,\nÂ \nI am trying to save the document in HTML format, and the library seems to fail to generate any content, if the spreadsheet relies on ROWS function. At first I thought that my document is corrupted, or that it has something to do with order of formula execution, but it seems to be the case even with simple documents. I can see the ROWS function in the library documentation, but apparently there is something wrong with it. I am using the 1.7.6 version of the library.",
