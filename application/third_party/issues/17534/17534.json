Should be very basic file, only few data in columns without formating.\nI need to parse this file programaticly without loading and resaving it in Excel. Can anybody help me or advise some programatic workaround if there is a problem with the file?\nThe file is attached.",

This file (CN859248_6.xls) can be read using the Excel2003XML Reader, but the reader doesn't support all features of that format, so some elements may be lost, though all data and most of the formatting should be read correctly. Style elements that can be read should be maintained when writing using the Excel5 writer. Please explain how you are reading the Excel2003XML and writing using Excel5.",

      "Message": "Reference(from http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/discussions/249298):\r\nMS Excel 2003 also introduced a new file format: XML Spreadsheet (aka XMLSS) which we can read using the Excel2003XML Reader, but we haven't yet written a writer for this format. However, this is not the default format for MS Excel 2003, it still uses BIFF version 8 as its default format, so we use the Excel5 Reader/Writer.\r\n\r\nNow, my file is Excel2003XML. It can be loaded with PHPExcel_IOFactory or PHPExcel_Reader_Excel2003XML(If load it by PHPExcel_Reader_Excel5, it happened error \"The filename aaa.xls is not recognised as an OLE file\"). However, it doesn't have a writer to Excel2003, i write it into bbb.xls with PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5. Normally, It works.  some warnings as follow:\r\n\r\nNotice: Undefined index: Default in D:\\xampp\\htdocs\\autoreport\\Classes\\PHPExcel\\Reader\\Excel2003XML.php on line 415\r\nCall Stack\r\n#\tTime\tMemory\tFunction\tLocation\r\n1\t0.0040\t412232\t{main}( )\t..\\access_test.php:0\r\n2\t0.2426\t3402608\tPHPExcel_Reader_Excel2003XML->load( )\t..\\access_test.php:341\r\n3\t0.2439\t3464040\tPHPExcel_Reader_Excel2003XML->loadIntoExisting( )\t..\\Excel2003XML.php:244\r\n\r\nThe warning is not import. However, It will lose style once the cell is empty and i need to keep the style(The final output file as attachment). What else i can do?\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your response, MarkBaker.",
