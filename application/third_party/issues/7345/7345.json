    "Description": "From: http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=33722\n \n--------------------------------------------------\nHi!\nThere was a discussion about germany locale and bug in PHPExcel with ‘,’ against ‘.’ in column widths. As I understand the bug was fixed in next releases. But it has not died in ru_RU locale.\n \nThe simple code does not work:\nsetlocale(LC_ALL, \"ru_RU.CP1251\");\nrequire_once  'PHPExcel/IOFactory.php';\n$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel2007');\n$objPHPExcel = $objReader->load(\"template/inv.xlsx\");  //the .xlsx file has column with non-default width\n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel2007');\n$objWriter->save('inv/temp.xlsx');\n \nAnd the second feature: after changing locale to ru_RU PHPExcel works well only with rounded row heights (like 15,00, 20,00, 100,00 etc.).  Any non-rounded height (like 15,75 or 20,15) will corrupt output file. Rounding column widths does not help anyway.\n \nI tested this code with latest sources from SVN (Changeset 16265).",
