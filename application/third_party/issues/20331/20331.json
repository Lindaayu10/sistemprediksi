    "Description": "The title says all. I'm at a complete loss. I've been trying for days on end to correct this issue myself with my extremely limited PHP knowledge, but to no avail.\n\nA month or so ago, PHPExcel worked without a hitch and loaded up and fetched values from an Excel 2007 spreadsheet I had, however, all of a sudden, I started to get this error, and it wouldn't correct itself. My website is hosted off of GoDaddy, and it's been on PHP 5.3.0 since the first day.\n\nI tried going back to Square One and reinstalling PHPExcel from scratch and using some of its example pages from within the PHPExcel distributable, but they would yield the same error. Thus, it's not an issue on my part, but with PHPExcel itself.\n\nI've done some PHP checks to make sure that the files exist and are accessible (including String.php), so I highly doubt it's due to missing files or incorrect file permissions (of which they're on 777 anyway).\n\nIf anybody could help me figure out why PHPExcel is doing this, I would so greatly appreciate it. If it helps to know, my site has WordPress and PrestaShop installed under their own unique subdirectories (PHPExcel is installed on the root, and the example pages are in a separate subdirectory as the installation states to do).\n\nGoogle has yielded me _/very/_ limited results: one place said that it was due to PHP 5.3.0 itself, while another said that the Autoloader itself had inconsistency issues. I don't know what to think.",
