    "Description": "Hello,\n \nI'm rather newbie with PHPExcel classes but I discovered something strange with the OpenOffice Reader Implementation (PHPExcel v1.7.1)... \n \nThe content of the A1 cell is always empty when I parse an ods file. \n \nIn my example, there are two columns in my ods file: the first one contains emails addresses and the second one contains random string elements.\n \nI converted my ods to xls with OO to test it with the Excel_5 parser and it works in this case... So, I presume it's a bug in the reader ?\n \nAny Ideas ?\n \nThanks a lot in advance for your help,\n \nBest,\n \nBenoît.",
