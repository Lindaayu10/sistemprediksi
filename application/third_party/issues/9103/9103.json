    "Description": "In real Excel files the cached calculated values from last successful calculation by the application is stored in the worksheet as well as the formulas. I believe we do not have the ability to read the cached calculated value in PHPExcel, i.e. the readers throw away the value.\n \nIt has been noted by gedrox that sometimes the cached calculated value may contain information which is not possible to recalculate by PHPExcel such as when the formula involves external files.\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=7895\n \nTodo: Think about what can be done so we can get cached calculated values?",
