    "Description": "I was working on style-heavy excel export recently and, during profiling, noticed that PHPExcel spends about 70% of execution time in PHPExcel::getCellXfByHashCode() (mostly called from PHPExcel_Style::applyFromArray())\n\nIt seems that adding a simple array cache to that method improves the speed (in my particular use-case) by a factor of 3, while only increasing memory usage by a negligible amount (cellXfCollection has something like 100 items, and I only store a pointer to an item in the cache).\n\nThe proposed patch doesn't break any additional unit tests (but I must note that there's a lot of unit tests broken with a pristine svn copy).",
