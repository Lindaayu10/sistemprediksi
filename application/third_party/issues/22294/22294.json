    "Description": "Version 1.8.0\n\nI've written a PHP class for reading selected columns from an Excel file and writing them to a database. The columns are selected using  a PHPExcel_Reader_IReadFilter subclass.\n\nWhen the file is in Excel2007 format, the code that loads the file works fine. When the file is in Excel2003XML format, however, the file doesn't load.\n\nI found that the Reader was always presenting the filter with Column A. I believe there's a bug in Classes/PHPExcel/Reader/Excel2003XML.php which can be fixed by this simple change.\n\n589d588\n< \n597a597\n>                 ++$columnID;",
