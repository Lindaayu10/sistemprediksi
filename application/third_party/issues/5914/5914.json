    "Description": "I think I may be onto something here.  The lines here:\n \n$conditionalStyles = $objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getStyle('B2')->getConditionalStyles();\narray_push($conditionalStyles, $objConditional1);\narray_push($conditionalStyles, $objConditional2);\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getStyle('B2')->setConditionalStyles($conditionalStyles);\n \n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->duplicateStyle( $objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getStyle('B2'), 'B3:B7' );\n \nare setting all of the cells B2:B7 to use the conditional formatting. However, something seems odd with applying both of the conditions.  In the excel file, editing any of the numbers in B2:B6 will produce the following results:\n \nIf the number is positive, or zero\n{\n     the font will be green, but no euro-symbol is present.  \n} else {\n     the euro-symbol will be present, but the font color (red in this case) will not be set\n}\n \nAlso, within Excel, going to:\n     \"Conditional Formatting\" -> \"Manage Rules\" -> Show rules for \"This Worksheet\" \nwill only show the rules where \"Cell Value >= 0\" -> Green font\nIt appears there is no conditional format rule for $objConditional1 at all\n \nI hope this helps in some way...",
