    "Description": "It would be great if you can customize installation to have only required files in installation folder.\nFor example, I only need to work only with Excel2007/2003. I don't need the rest.\nSo I could choose only to have those files required for Excel2007/2003 to work.\nNow my project's library is 39.9MB with 39.4MB Only for PHPExcel.\nÂ \nThere goes my 2 cents.",

This year will also see some refactoring of the code, which will reduce this footprint still further.",
