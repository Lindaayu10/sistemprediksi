Consider as a draft, subject to change.\nThis can avoid loading each time the template file for the sole purpose to recover the macros, the Ribbon. These methods also help define the appropriate codeName.\r\n\r\nThe change of name (by setTitle) does not change the codeName, operation similar to Excel, so the attached code continues to operate: you have a sheet named 'Synthesis January 2013\" with event procedures, today you want to name this sheet \"Synthesis April 2013\", you call setTitle() to do, event procedures are not disrupted. \nConversely, if it is difficult to clean the previous data in a sheet, you take his codeName, you delete the sheet, and then you create a new worksheet in which you give the appropriate title and the saved codeName.",
