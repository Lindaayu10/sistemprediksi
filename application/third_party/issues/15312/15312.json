Right now hey are not in the actual /var/tmp, which is my actual tmp directory but it /tmp which is symbolic for /usr/tmpDSK.\nÂ \nI've disabled Excel imports, they'll have to be done manually by conversion to tab-delimited, until I can get this worked out.",

      "Message": "DiskISAM uses the temporary directory identified by a call to sys_get_temp_dir(). There is currently no method to set the temporary directory manually.\r\n\r\nThere are a few issues with this PHP function, that was only introduced in PHP 5.2.1, especially if PHP is being run with the suhosin patch.\r\n\r\nTo get round these issues, we do have a customised version of the function in the PHPExcel_Shared_File class. I've modified the DiskISAM class to use this customised version rather than the standard sys_get_temp_dir(). Hopefully this will resolve your problem.\r\n",

      "Message": "I need to be able to create fairly large Excel 2007 workbooks - lots of numbers, very little formatting.  I'd like to be able to create at least 64000 rows x 50 columns.  I'll be running on a Linux RedHat 64-bit environment with plenty of memory and timing is not an issue - this is essentially batch initiated from a web page.  Unfortunately we've been configured with only a 2GB /tmp file and that's set as our default temp directory - we've already crashed the dev server by filling that up (oops).\r\nBottom line - I have a couple of questions / requests:\r\n   1) How can I point the temporary file creation to a file system of my choice?  I've looked at the DiscISAM and PHPExcel_Shared_File classes and I just don't know enough to be able to fiddle :) (I could use an example, please)\r\n   2) I think it would be a Good Thing to be able to \"chunkify\" writing the output file - to write a few rows, save the file, write a few more ... and remove the inactive rows from memory.  I have no idea how difficult this would be, but it seems like a logical approach to the issue.   We just want to deliver a (barely) formatted Excel file which is essentially a dump of a bunch of records from our database for our users.",

I tried simply editing that function to return another directory, but it doesn't seem to get called.\r\nWe're at 5.3.something of PHP and sys_get_temp_dir is alive and well.\r\nThe /tmp directory is cleared regularly, but PHPExcel is creating very very large files - as I said, enough to crash the system.\r\nAre there cache settings I can pass to point to the tmp directory we want to use?\r\n",
