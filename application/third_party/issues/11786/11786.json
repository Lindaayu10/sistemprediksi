If I remove those characters, Excel opens the file flawlessly and without that creepy message.\r\n\r\nBTW... I'm using Windows 7 with Excel 2007 and tried on another pc with Windows 7 and Excel 2010.\r\n\r\nI've attached a file generated with Excel5 writer and having test data (just a bunch of strings repeated in every cell)",
