      "Message": "Tests are going well. I think this feature will be ready for PHPExcel 1.6.4 at least for BIFF8 spreadsheets (Excel 97 to Excel 2003). The formula support will cover the majority of formulas one would encounter in a typical Excel spreadsheet. However, array formulas are not being targeted for support at the moment. Like-wise formulas involving add-in functions.",

BIFF5 spreadsheets (Excel 5.0 - Excel 95) - formula support not yet implemented, cell will contain formula result only.\r\n2. BIFF8 (Excel 97 - Excel 2003): If formula can be read, cell will contain formula like in Excel2007 reader.\r\n3. BIFF8 (Excel 97 - Excel 2003): If formula can not be read, cell will contain formula result only (like before this feature was enabled).\r\n----\r\nAdditional formula support may be addressed in separate work items.",
