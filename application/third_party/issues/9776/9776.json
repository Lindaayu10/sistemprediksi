    "Description": "From thread:\nhttp://phpexcel.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=53317\n \nHello! I have a trouble with generated PDF files with cyrillis words.\n \nI generat $objPHPExcel with Russian words in cells. To let it be displayed in Excel properly, I convert words from native CP1251 (windows-1251) to UTF8:  mb_convert_encoding($text, 'UTF8', 'CP1251'). It works and displayed correctly both in Excel2007 and Excel5. Then I create PDF using PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'PDF');.  PDF file creates successfully but! Russian words are displayed like multiple question marks (\"?\" symbols). I suppose that PDF is created without necessary fonts. I look through the created file and found:\n/BaseFont /Helvetica-Bold\n/Subtype /Type1\n/Encoding /WinAnsiEncoding\n \nAs far as I know, WinAnsiEncoding has no russian letters in it. WinAnsi is 1252 - west europen charset, but I need 1251.. \n \nIn   public function __construct($orientation='P', $unit='mm', $format='A4', $unicode=true, $encoding='UTF-8', $diskcache=false) {..     I changed $unicode to false and $encoding to cp1251 (windows-1251) thinking that necessary encoding will be set. But I was wrong. It makes almost no effect. Multiple question marks just replaced with symbols like.... like \"N Ñ\" in spanish (with tilde ~ above it), strikethrough \"D Ð\", bold dots between symbols and others..\n \nCan you advice me something on how to generate PDF with russian words in it?\n \nI can send created files on email if it needed. Just let me know.",
