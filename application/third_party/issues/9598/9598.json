    "Description": "We have received a script that was generating corrupt Excel 2007 files.\n \nIt turned out that sheet names were set to be longer than 31 characters which is apparently the limit in Excel 2007 as well as BIFF8.\n \nPerhaps we should throw an exception for this. Patch for review.\n \nTest:\n----\n$excel = new PHPExcel();\n \n$sheet = $excel->getActiveSheet(0);\n$sheet->setTitle('aäâáàbcdeéèëêfghiíìïjklmnoóòöøpq'); // 32 characters, this is too long\n \n$writer = new PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007($excel);\n$writer->save('write.xlsx');\n \nExpected result:\n----\nThrow exception?\n \nActual result:\n----\nWorkbook generated, but it opens as corrupt in MS Office Excel. (Not clear from the generic error message in MS Office Excel)\n \nEnvironment:\n----\nPHPExcel 1.6.6",
