      "Message": "It's very difficult to tell what the problem is without seeing the file itself. PHPExcel doesn't recognise the bytemarks normally used to identify an OLE file, such as those generated by MS Office... specifically a byte sequence of 0xd0, 0xcf, 0x11, 0xe0, 0xa1, 0xb1, 0x1a, 0xe1 as the first 8 bytes of the file. Is it possible for you to upload the file as an attachment to this work item?",

      "Message": "Hi Mark,\r\nYes. I have attached my excel file (named any.xls).\r\nThanks for the quick reply. \r\nI tried using another .xls created by the MS Office Version 2003. This worked perfect.\r\nAs per my understanding, the .xls file created by 2007 Version of MS Office generates the 8 bytes sequence and hence raised an exception. So, the quick fix that i have now for my problem is that, Create the .xls file from 2003 Office Environment and use them. \r\n\r\nAdditional Information about my Work Environment:\r\nOS: Windows 7\r\nMS Office Version: 2007\r\nPHP Version: 5.3.5\r\nServer: WAMP\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there is a fix for this.\r\n\r\nThanks Again,\r\nVathsan",
