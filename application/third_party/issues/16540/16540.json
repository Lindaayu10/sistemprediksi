    "Description": "We are using PHPExcel to read multiple excel files with the same filename located in different folders in an iterative way. File size is around 70 kb, in each files there are 5 sheets with identical structure and cross links within the sheets.\n \nAfter the first file has been loaded, the second file is loaded but the values retrieved with getCellByColumnAndRow returns the values of the first opened file.\nEven if disconnectWorksheets and unset is done after each file, there seems to be a problem in managing multiple files having the same filename. \n \nHere the code:\nwhile(list($id, $folder) = each($folder_array)){\n\t$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader(\"Excel2007\");\n        $objPHPExcel = $objReader->load($folder.\"\\\\\".\"excelfile.xlsm\");\n        $cell_value = $objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getCellByColumnAndRow(5 , 7)->getCalculatedValue();\n        $objPHPExcel->disconnectWorksheets();\n\tunset($objPHPExcel);\n}\n \n$cell_value is always the value of the first excelfile !! This should not be the case ! When i do a sleep(20) after unset, the values are correct. However, as we read more than 50 files, this is not a solution.\n \nI tried to read only the relevant ranges of cells, but same results as soon as i read more than one sheet.\n \nAppreciate your help on this.\n \nAxel",
