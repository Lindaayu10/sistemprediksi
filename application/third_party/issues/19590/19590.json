    "Description": "In cache process for SQLite or SQLite3, there are somes queries which looks \"dangerous\" with not escaped parameters.\n\nEx: \nFile PHPExcel/CachedObjectStorage/SQLite3.php\n\nFunction: \"isDataSet\"\n```\n  \"public function isDataSet($pCoord) {\n```\n\nCode : \n```\n  $query = \"SELECT id FROM kvp_\".$this->_TableName.\" WHERE id='\".$pCoord.\"'\";\n```\nThe use of $pCoord seems dangerous in such SQL query.\n\nThis function is called from \"Worksheet.php\" by function \"getCell(...)\" or by function \"getCellByColumnAndRow(...)\"\n\nSo if someone can pass special parameter to getCellByColumnAndRow(...) with SQL inside, he could inject/execute SQL commands.\n\nIn fact, it seems not to dangerous because it's SQLite engine and in \"memory\" database, but it could be great if queries doesn't look dangerous.\n\n$pCoord is a column letter and a number, so it could be treated with \"sqlite_escape_string(...)\".",
