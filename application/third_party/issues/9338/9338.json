    "Description": "It has been noted by that many are having problems writing formulas using PHPExcel because it is not obvious what language to use.\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=42854\n \nWe could expand section 4.3.4 (Write a formula into a cell) in the PHPExcel Developer Documentation, or include some information about this in the PHPExcel Function Reference Developer Documentation.\n \nHere is a suggestion for some added text:\n \n--------\nInside the Excel file, formulas are always stored as they would appear in an English version of MS Office Excel. This is irregardless of which language version of MS Office Excel you may have used to create the Excel file.\n \nTherefore, when you write formulas with PHPExcel you must always use English formulas. The following rules hold:\n \nDecimal separator is '.' (period)\nFunction argument separator is ',' (comma)\nMatrix row separator is ';' (semicolon)\nAlways use English function name\n \nWhen the final workbook is opened by the user, MS Office Excel will take care of displaying the formula according the applications language. Translation is taken care of by the application!\n \n---------",
