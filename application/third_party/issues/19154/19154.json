    "Description": "I am using PHPExcel extension for read/write excel files. Now I have a problem with reading the date format from excel file. In the excel file, for the date column, the data is \"12/31/2012\". ie \"mm/dd/yyyy\".\n\n\n                $objPHPExcel = new PHPExcel();\n                $inputFileName = 'uploads/'.$filename;\n                $objPHPExcel = PHPExcel_IOFactory::load($inputFileName);\n                $sheetData = $objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->toArray(null, true, true, true);\n\n\nThis is the code I am using to read the excel file. When I print the $sheetData array, the date is showing as \"12-31-12\". ie, \"mm-dd-yy\"\n\nNote that, only some excel files are showing this strange result.",
