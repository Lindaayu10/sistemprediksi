      "Message": "Concur. The echo is historic from when I was actually developing the calculation engine, and wanted to errors immediately. I actually had a debug_backtrace in there as well, to provide all the details of the error.\r\n\r\nI'll modify the method to remove the echo - it will still throw an exception or trigger a user error, based on the suppressFormulaErrors setting - and make it protected.\r\n\r\n",
