    "Description": "After upgrading to PHP 5.4, I received the following warning:\n\"Warning: Illegal string offset 'value' in /var/www/html/PHPExcel/Calculation.php on line 2976\"\n \nThe issue is that PHP 5.4 is more strict with array operations. Therefore, it is necessary to first confirm that $opCharacter is indeed an array before running the statement on line 2976: \nif ($opCharacter['value'] == '(') return $this->_raiseFormulaError(\"Formula Error: Expecting ')'\");\n \nProposed fix starting at line 2975 of PHPExcel/Calculation.php:\nwhile (!is_null($op = $stack->pop())) {\t// pop everything off the stack and push onto output\n\t\t\t// PHP 5.4 patch - check to see if $opCharacter is an array first\n\t\t\tif (is_array($opCharacter)) {\n\t\t\t\tif ($opCharacter['value'] == '(') return $this->_raiseFormulaError(\"Formula Error: Expecting ')'\");\t// if there are any opening braces on the stack, then braces were unbalanced\n\t\t\t}\t\t\t\n\t\t\t$output[] = $op;\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn $output;",
