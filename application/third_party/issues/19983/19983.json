    "Description": "I have an issue with PHPExcel_Writer_HTML regarding handling of merged cells. (version 1.7.9\n\nI have a row of regular cells, followed by a row, that has the first 3 cells merged. The colSpan is generated, but applied to the first row, not the second.\n\nWhen i look at the code in PHPExcel_Writer_HTML::_generateRow in Line 1229, it seems that it is actually doing a kind of \"lookahead\", fetching the spans information from the next row ($pRow + 1).\nThis explains the behavior described above.\n\nBut this leads to a wrong result.\n\nIs this bug known already? How can i solve or workaround this problem?\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nMany thanks",
