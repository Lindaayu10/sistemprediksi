    "Description": "I'm using v1.8 of PHPexcel and php5.3 on debian squeez. \n\nMy spreadsheet is containing 32000 lines x 15 fields - no formatting.\nUsing sqlite cell caching the job requires about 44Mb of memory. \n\nHere is an observation:\nOnce created the sheet, I try to rename the sheet - this fails with out of memory (256Mb max right now).\nI'm renaming now in the beginning of the job - means, before filling the xls with data.\n\nOnce trying to write the spreadsheet with Excel2007, the objWriter->save action runs out of memory..\n\nAny help/clues? I read all sorts of articles about memory issues - but I did not find one which seem to fit my issue...\n\nThanks, Cugar",
