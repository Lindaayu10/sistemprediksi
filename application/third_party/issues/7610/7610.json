If you make it 2, everything is fine. \n\nTry this in Excel:\n- Fit to width: 1; fit to height: blank\n- Save the file\n- Open it in Package Explorer (or unzip it and check sheet1.xml)\n- Notice it is not saved! Fit to width is not in there!\n- Seems like it is stored in printersettings.bin, some binary stuff Excel adds\n\n** Closed by maartenba 9/17/2008 2:40 AM",
