      "Message": "OK! Then perhaps it's not encrypted; but it contains a file password block in the workbook stream which (according to the MS Excel documentation) means that it's encrypted. What isn't documented by Microsoft is how Excel handles encrypted files, making it impossible for PHPExcel to decrypt an encrypted file; so if it encounters a file password block then it stops trying to parse the file",

I can see that it's encrypted with __SEAL (Secure Encryption Algorithm)__, which currently there is no documentation for on how to decrypt, so unfortunately you will have to unprotect the file manually and save it in an unprotected state.",

I've yet to look at it, and doubt if I'll get much chance today due to real-world pressures of work; but I should get an opportunity to test it over the coming week... so there's real hope that the next release will allow reading of password protected xls files.",
