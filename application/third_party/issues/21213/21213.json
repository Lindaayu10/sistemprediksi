    "Description": "So I have this template which has images.  I use PHP copy to copy that template and use it as a new workbook.  When I check the file, the images are still there.  However, when I read the worksheet, then use write to add data to the template, the images disappear.\n\nDo I have to manually insert the images by code?  Is there a way I can retain the images from the template?",
