    "ClosedComment": "Upgraded tcPDF to version 5.9.009 &#40;2010-10-21&#41; fixes the initial issues with borders, although there are still problems with borders in merged cells. It is also a big performance overhead&#58; tcPDF is already horrendously slow and bloated, and performance has degraded still further with this upgrade.",

    "Description": "Border style of text cells is ignored when generating a PDF from an Excel template in version 1.7.3c.\nA Border is always drawn even if there is no border in the original Excel. \nProbably, this issue has to be corrected in PHPExcel\\Shared\\PDF\\tcpdf.php.\nÂ \nIt can be reproduced with the following code:\n\tinclude_once \"PHPExcel/Reader/Excel5.php\";\n\t$objReader = new PHPExcel_Reader_Excel5();\n\t$objPHPExcel  = $objReader->load('bordertest.xls');\n\tinclude_once 'PHPExcel/Writer/PDF.php';\n\t$objWriter = new PHPExcel_Writer_PDF($objPHPExcel);\n\t$objWriter->writeAllSheets();\n\t$objWriter->save('bordertest.pdf');",
