It would probably be possible to modify Excel5 writer so the extra functionality (align with margins) is available when one opens the xls file in MS Office Excel 2007, but not in previous version (with or without compatibility pack). This is possible because some extra data is stored in the xls file when saved by MS Office Excel 2007.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is what you are requesting?",
