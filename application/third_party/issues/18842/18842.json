    "Description": "Hi Guys,\n\nI'm having a issue with some styling from an outputted file using PHPExcel. I take an initial template excel file that has some conditional formatting in the cells (changes color when an 'x' is in the cell). Then I fill the template using PHPExcel and every thing works fine except.....\n\nThat I can no longer center the text of the cells that have been filled by phpexcel. The original cells were centered but no the text remains left aligned no mater what I do (see yellow cell in the attached file). \n\nAlso there is a strange issue where a single cell gets two 'x' values (see the red cell)\n\nAny ideas what I could be doing wrong?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nBrian",
