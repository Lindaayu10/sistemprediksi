    "Description": "Hi, \nI did several tests on latest SVN version (92409) on graphics theme and I discovered a bug.\nIn my model, I put an histogram on the first tab. Ordinates (Y axis) are data (range of cells) from second tab (document: graph_medium.xltx)\nLoad and save this document doesn't ask problem.\n \nNow I had a range of cells on abscissa (X axis) like in graph_hard.xltx.\nI load model, I save it. Ouput document is genrated but histogram is lost with errors in excel document.\nMy PHP code:\n$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel2007');\n$objReader->setIncludeCharts(TRUE);\n$objPHPExcel = $objReader->load('graph_hard.xltx');\n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel2007');\n$objWriter->setIncludeCharts(TRUE);\n$objWriter->save('output.xlsx');\n \nCould you correct it please ?\nThanks",
