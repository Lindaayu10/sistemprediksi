    "Description": "Hi,\n \nI have a problem with reading an xlsx file and write to a new xlsx file. The cells (or cell-height and cell-width) seem to disappear. The problem does not occur when I use a .xls file to read from, even if I save it as .xlsx\n \nThe original file is created with LibreOffice, maybe this is a problem?\n \nZip is enabled and I don't get any error messages. I use the PHP version is 5.3.6-13ubuntu3.3\n \nIn the attached Zip file are the original file (test.xlsx), the output (test2.xlsx) and a demo code i used (test.php)",
