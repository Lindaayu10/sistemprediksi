    "Description": "I wrote a PHP script that created a spreadsheet with 7 tabs in Excel 5 format.  I have Office 2003 installed on my machine.\n \nIf someone attempts to open this spreadsheet on a machine that has an earlier version of Office installed, then at opening an error is raised about attempting to fix a corrupt file, and when the spreadsheet is actually displayed the first two tabs are missing.\n \nIf the same PHP script is run on the machine with the earlier version of Office installed, the resulting spreadsheet that is created opens perfectly with no errors.\n \nA file compare between the two files shows only 1 difference.  The hex string \"00 B8 03 24 0A\" in the file with problems is shown in the working file as \"80 A2 B3 80 0B\".  Please note that this hex string is written twice.\n \nI have attached both excel files within a zip file.  The file titled \"wrong\" is created on the machine which had Excel 2003 installed.  The file titled \"right\" is created on a machine which had an earlier version of Excel installed.\n \nI hope this helps.",
