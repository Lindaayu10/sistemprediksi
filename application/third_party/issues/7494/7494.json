    "Description": "From http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=34770\n \nWhen one reads a spreadsheet using Excel2007 reader together with the setReadDataOnly(true) option one finds that Rich-Text cell values are not converted to plain text. This may be a bit surprising since all other cell formatting (fonts, colors etc.) is removed during the load process. Besides being surprising I think it may be impractical too and I am therefore asking whether or not it would be better to return plain text whenever one uses setReadDataOnly(true).\n \nExample:\nConsider that one wants to use PHPExcel to process orders submitted via Excel 2007 spreadsheets. In such situations I think one would rarely be interested in more than plain text. Still it may be hard to prevent the customer from inserting Rich-Text because this may happen accidentally when copying from other applications such as Microsoft Office Word. To process a spreadsheet that may or may not contain Rich-Text one would have to use multiple constructions like this to get the plain text:\n \n$value = $cell->getValue();\n \n// get plain text\n$plainText = ($value instanceof PHPExcel_RichText) ?\n    $value->getPlainText() : $value;\n \nWhat should be the effect of setReadDataOnly(true) for cell values? A guideline could be this: It gives what you see in the Microsoft Office Excel formula bar after selecting number format \"General\".",
