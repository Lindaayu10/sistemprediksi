    "Description": "I installed 1.5.0 and since for me is really important utf8 support I have looked over issue tracking and found this \"fix\" mentioned in 4126.\nQuote:\n\"Adding\n\"$workbook->setVersion(8);\"\nafter\n\"$workbook = new PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5_Writer($pFilename);\" (Writer/Excel5.php, line 82)\nshould solve this problem. \"\n \nThis change makes utf8 strings appear in excel correctly, but it produces corrupted xls files starting from some amount of data containing in xls. I have around 1000 letters in one line (distributed accross columns) and when it gets approximately more then 100 lines - file gets corrupted. however same data but which fits in ~50 lines - xls file is produced normal.\n \nxls columns contains this:\n \nData time, 8 char string, name family name (utf8 string), personal id, ip, ip location, browser id (typical length 100+chars), random java cookie string, and after 3 colums more with 10-20 length strings.\n(in case you want to reproduce it, if really needed I can write some php script which makes corrupted xls)",
