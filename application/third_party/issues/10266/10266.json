    "Description": "Open XML spreadsheets build using MS's Open XML SDK v2 CTP open fine in Excel 2007, but do not load fully in PHPExcel. The apparent reason behind this is the SDK puts all relationship targets in as root-relative paths. Because of that, the file doesn't load correctly (it gets to a certain point, but as soon as it tries do anything with the sheets, like set the active sheet index during load, it errors out because there are none loaded).\n \nWhile digging through the Excel2007 reader looking for a solution, I noticed many instances where an Apache POI workaround was put in place (Reader/Excel2007.php, lines 255-257, 278-280, etc) that appears to be there solely to remove the leading slash and try loading the file a second time. All of those instances work for files generated by the SDK, but there aren't any workarounds put in for the shared strings, styles, sheets, and probably most other pieces not in the main relationship file.\n \nSince we know that root-relative paths won't work, does it make sense to create a separate helper function to clean up the path and use that every time a target is referenced in the reader? We may actually need two, since there are cases where the directory is combined with it (Reader/Excel2007.php, line 306) and that do not work if the xpath[Target] returns a root-relative path. In those cases, using the xpath value alone appears to work fine. Then all of the POI hacks should be able to be pulled out, and it should open/handle any Open XML file using root-relative paths in any of its relationship files.",
