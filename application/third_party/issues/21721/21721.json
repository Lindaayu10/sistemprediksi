    "Description": "I experience a strange situation: \n 1) environment on unix with a old PHP installation (version: 5.1.2) and none of the extensions mentioned as prerequisites, where PHPExcel works well (I can run examples and my code too, to generate/download xls files $excel_version='Excel5')\n 2) similar environment on unix with recent PHP installation (version: 5.4.17) with xml extension loaded (still no gd or g2 extension) where PHPExcel does NOT work (it seems to get stuck when instantiating PHPExcel object:$objPHPExcel = new PHPExcel(); )\n\nPlease clarify the following regarding PHPExcel prerequisites:\n1. is gd extension indeed needed? If yes, how does it work in environment #1 without gd extension ? Please provide a link from where I could download this extension for unix and how to install it.\n2. is there some other prerequisite that is not mentioned?\n3. is PHP version 5.2 or later a must or it is just recommended? in my environment #1 it works under 5.1.2. \n4. how could I find out what is not properly installed on environment #2? please advise what can I do to fix it.\n\nPlease refer to the details below regarding loaded extensions (info displayed using functions get loaded_extensions and extension_loaded). \n\nEnvironment #1 --> PHPExcel works:\nCurrent PHP version: 5.1.2\nloaded extensions:\nArray\n(\n    [0] => tokenizer\n    [1] => standard\n    [2] => SPL\n    [3] => PDO\n    [4] => session\n    [5] => sockets\n    [6] => SQLite\n    [7] => Reflection\n    [8] => posix\n    [9] => pdo_sqlite\n    [10] => oci8\n    [11] => mbstring\n    [12] => iconv\n    [13] => hash\n    [14] => date\n    [15] => ctype\n    [16] => pcre\n    [17] => apache\n)\nextensions for PHPExcel:\n  gd extension not loaded!\n  gd2 extension not loaded!\n  xml extension not loaded!\n  zip extension not loaded!\n\n\nEnvironment #2 --> PHPExcel does NOT work:\nCurrent PHP version: 5.4.17\nloaded extensions:\nArray\n(\n    [0] => Core\n    [1] => date\n    [2] => ereg\n    [3] => libxml\n    [4] => pcre\n    [5] => sqlite3\n    [6] => ctype\n    [7] => dom\n    [8] => fileinfo\n    [9] => filter\n    [10] => hash\n    [11] => iconv\n    [12] => json\n    [13] => oci8\n    [14] => SPL\n    [15] => PDO\n    [16] => pdo_sqlite\n    [17] => session\n    [18] => posix\n    [19] => Reflection\n    [20] => standard\n    [21] => SimpleXML\n    [22] => Phar\n    [23] => tokenizer\n    [24] => xml\n    [25] => xmlreader\n    [26] => xmlwriter\n    [27] => apache2handler\n)\nextensions for PHPExcel:\n  gd extension not loaded!\n  gd2 extension not loaded!\nxml extension loaded...\n  zip extension not loaded!",
