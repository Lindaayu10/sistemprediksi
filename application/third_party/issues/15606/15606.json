    "Description": "Hi,\n \nI've a spreahsheet that contains Dependent Lists. I'm using Defined Ranges in another Sheet and the INDIRECT function as Data Vaidation. This is used as a template that Excel5 writes too and a user downloads. In the downloaded file, the Defined Ranges are still there but the INDIRECT function I used in the Data Validation is gone.\n \nIs this a bug or something that is not supported or even better if there is another way to acheive this using the Excel5 writer.",
