    "Description": "What would it take to implement workbook sharing. Not necessarily a full implementation with revision control, but just the ability to set a boolean somewhere in some object to indicate that a workbook is shared?\n \nQuote from thread:\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=37582\n \nI have an excel file and I want to share it so that differents users can write in it at the same time.\nThe expected behaviour would be like: I have an excel file opened and I go to the main menu to Tools->Share Workbook and in the opened window I select \"Allow changes by more than one user at the same time. This also allows workbook merging\".\nIs there a property to be set for Excel2007 document in order to make it shareable?",

If I understand the problem correctly, there may be scenarios where it would still be useful just to get the boolean working before any more complete implementation.\r\n|\r\nExample:\r\nWorkbook shared.xlsx is located on server. Employers have shared access to the file and commit changes when day is finished.\r\nPHP-script runs every night and does some clean up in the workbook, then puts it back again for next day, still being shared.",
