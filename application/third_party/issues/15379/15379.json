    "Description": "I created a workbook with the local name \"Department.name\" in a sheet, referencing a single cell (B7). Then I accessed that cell in a formula (E11: formula \"=Department.name\"). Excel is evaluating ok, showing the value of cell B7 in cell E11. When I try to write the file with PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007->save(), the parser reaches Calculation.php:2870 and throws the corresponding error.",
