    "Description": "Hello. I'm using PHPExcel in a tool for manipulating xls files, and it is a godsend. Thank you very much for all your hard work.\n \nThere's just one issue I'm having at the moment: My xls files often have Japanese sheet names, and all formulas containing references to cells on these sheets, no matter how simple the formula may be, will cause getCalculatedValue() to throw an exception:\n \"Formula Error: An unexpected error occured\".\n \nI imagine this could be an encoding issue, or lack of consideration for multibyte sheet names? Is there anything I can do to get around this? (Renaming the sheets is not an option).\n \nI've made a simple test file that demonstrates this problem. I can supply it to you if it would be helpful.\n \nThank you for any advice you can offer.",

      "Message": "Not as simple as just setting the /u flag. I've modified the cell reference regexp to ((((?:\\P{M}\\p{M}*)+?)|(\\'[^\\']*\\')|(\\\"[^\\\"]*\\\"))!)?\\$?([a-z]{1,3})\\$?(\\d+) which works with your test worksheet; and I've tested it against a couple of slightly more complex test formulae such as  =シート2!A2+シート2!A3 (having populated A2 and A3 on sheet  =シート2). However, I'm still not completely satisfied. I've checked the modified code into SVN. If you could test that latest code against your real formulae, and confirm that it works with that, then I'll flag this issue as fixed.\r\n",
