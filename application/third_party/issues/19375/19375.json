    "Description": "I am using phpexcel and i am loading a template file and updating cell values. I am using Excel2007 as the reader type.\n\nThe problem i am having is i have multiple cells that have a Currency format but some cells loose that format and gets switch to general format in the final file.\n*You will notice the first curency field in the template is B10, the final file this gets changed to general. but other currency fields are ok.\n\nAlso I have row colors and charts in the template. The final file changes some row colors to different colors and charts font sizes get set to a huge font and so forth.\n*You will notice cell colors are different slightly and the charts text font and colors gets changed.\n\nDeleting/Removing a does not upgrade the charts cell correlations..\n*You will notice that the graphs are still pulling from row 37 - 46 after i delete a row above it, when it should have updated to be pulling from 36 - 45. in the final file you can click on a pie chart and see its is referncing the wrong cells.\n\nI am including a sample template file and sample php code file to replicate.\n\nThanks\nJason k.",
