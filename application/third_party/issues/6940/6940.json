    "Description": "Hi, I've been trying to lock some cells and haven't been able to do it.  I'm using the Excel5 version.  Here is the code that I'm using (Where $cell will take the value of \"I11\" and \"I12\"):\n \n$objPHPExcel=align_cell($objPHPExcel,$cell,'Center');\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getStyle($cell)->getNumberFormat()->setFormatCode(PHPExcel_Style_NumberFormat::FORMAT_NUMBER_COMMA_SEPARATED1);\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getProtection()->setSheet(true);\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getStyle($cell)->getProtection()->setLocked(PHPExcel_Style_Protection::PROTECTION_PROTECTED);\n \nNow, when the code finishes, I get the format of the Cell and the Worksheets gets protected.  However, the cells are not protected and can be modified.  Could you please help me?  I'm attaching the resulting file.  Thank you,",

      "Message": "I tried your script and there does seem to be a problem with Excel5 writer and locked cells:\r\n\r\nsetLocked(PHPExcel_Style_Protection::PROTECTION_PROTECTED)\r\nsetLocked(PHPExcel_Style_Protection::PROTECTION_UNPROTECTED)\r\n\r\nboth seem to produce *unlocked* cells in conjunction with Excel5 writer. Maybe someone else can explain how that is happening?\r\n\r\nJust wondering a bit about your script. I think that all cells should be locked by default just like when you create a new Excel document in Office. You would normally not have to explicitly lock a cell. Therefore when you use \r\n\r\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getProtection()->setSheet(true);\r\n\r\nautomatically, it should not be possible to edit the cells.\r\n\r\nI had difficulties testing because I only have MS Office Excel 2007 installed and it does not really like the xls documents created by Excel5 writer (see http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=5008), so my test is based on inspection of the document in Open Office 2.4.1\r\n",
