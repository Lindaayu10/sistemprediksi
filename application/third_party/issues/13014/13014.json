    "Description": "I am trying to load an excel file containing several worksheets.  \nHowever, I will not know the name of the sheets as the user may change them.  So I will need to load each sheet in sequence without knowing its name.  Is this possible?\n \nI know that I can use the following: $objReader->setLoadSheetsOnly() but I need to know the name of the sheet right? Can I use an index instead?\n \nThank you for your help",
