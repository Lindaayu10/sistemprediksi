Converts to HTML, excel and excel2003.\nWhen it tries to convert to PDF it fails here:\n \nFile : Writer/PDF.php\n \nline :47\n\t\t$pdfLibraryName = PHPExcel_Settings::getPdfRendererName();\n \n\t\tif (is_null($pdfLibraryName)) {\n\t\t\tthrow new Exception(\"PDF Rendering library has not been defined.\");\n\t\t}",

      "Message": "It looks as though PHPReport is using the latest github code.\r\n\r\nThis has removed the included 3rd-party tcPDF library (which didn't produce good output and was seriously bloated) and instead allows you to select whether you wish to use tcPDF, domPDF or mPDF as the PDF rendering library - your choice, but one where you must install the 3rd-party library yourself. Then, before using PHPExcel's PDF writer, you need to tell it which library you are using, and where it can find that library.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n//$rendererName = PHPExcel_Settings::PDF_RENDERER_MPDF;\r\n$rendererName = PHPExcel_Settings::PDF_RENDERER_DOMPDF;\r\n//$rendererLibrary = 'tcPDF5.9';\r\n//$rendererLibrary = 'mPDF5.4';\r\n$rendererLibrary = '/path/to/my/libraries/domPDF0.6.0beta3';\r\n\r\nif (!PHPExcel_Settings::setPdfRenderer(\r\n\t\t$rendererName,\r\n\t\t$rendererLibraryPath\r\n\t)) {\r\n\tdie(\r\n\t\t'NOTICE: Please set the $rendererName and $rendererLibraryPath values' .\r\n\t\tEOL .\r\n\t\t'at the top of this script as appropriate for your directory structure'\r\n\t);\r\n}\r\n",
