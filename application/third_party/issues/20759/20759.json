    "Description": "I use PHPExcel 1.7.8 and i'm trying to read a ODS file.\nIn my ODS file i've 9 sheets  and i ask if it's possible to load the ODS file, set the value of one cell and get value of another cell that depends from the last cell that i modified ?\n\nI write the steps that i used in my code:\n\n$objPHPExcel = new PHPExcel();\n$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('OOCalc');\nPHPExcel_Calculation::getInstance()->setCalculationCacheEnabled(false);\n$cell = 'D5';\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue($cell, 'xxxxxxx');\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->getCell($cell)->getValue(); // in 'D5' there is the following value 'xxxxxxx'\n\n// i want to read on the sheet number 5 and in the cell 'I3' there is a formula that depends from cell D5\n$cell = 'I3';\n$objPHPExcel->getSheet(5)->getCell($cell)->getOldCalculatedValue();\n$objPHPExcel->getSheet(5)->getCell($cell)->getCalculatedValue(); \n$objPHPExcel->getSheet(5)->getCell($cell)->getValue();\n\n// after these previous instructions i didn't obtain the correct calculated value",
