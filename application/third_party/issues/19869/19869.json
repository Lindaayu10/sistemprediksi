    "Description": "After updating version from 1.7.8 to 1.7.9 I found that if you call $cell->getCalculatedValue() on formula cell, and then you want show column where you are with $cell->getColumn() it returns last column from formula, not column from which you want value.\nfor example:\nIn excel I have in cell A1 formula =B1+C1\nin PHP :\ngo throw all rows and column...\n$cell->getColumn() -> return A <= it's OK\n$cell->getCalculatedValue() => return good value\n$cell->getColumn() -> return C <= WRONG, it should return A",

      "Message": "The perils of supporting caching so that only one cell is ever \"active\" at any point in time, as the \"active\" cell changes during calculation when it is necessary to retrieve values from other cells to evaluate the formula.... I know how to fix it, but it's unlikely to be before the 2.0 release, especially as it affects anything that changes the currently active cell. For the calc engine, I maintain a recursive list of referenced cells, so I can backtrack that to restore the currently active cell; for other features that change the active cell (such as the column width autosize), I'll need to save and restore.",
