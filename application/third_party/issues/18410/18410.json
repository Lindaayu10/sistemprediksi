    "Description": "I am not able to set styles using the applyFromArray() function. When I trace through the code I notice that the cell range I provide somehow gets converted to A1, but even that is not applying the style changes I wish to make.\n \nI am starting with a copy of a template workbook from which I make a copy of the template worksheet:\n \n\t$objXLTmpl\t\t\t= $objReader->load($rTmpl);\n\t$objXL\t\t\t\t= $objXLTmpl->copy();\n \nI then make a copy of the worksheet:\n \n\t\t\t$objSheet\t\t= $objXL->getSheetByName(Template)->copy();\n\t\t\t$objSheet->setTitle($tabLabel);\n\t\t\t$objXL->addExternalSheet($objSheet);\n\t\t\t$objXL->setActiveSheetIndex($objXL->getIndex($objXL->getSheetByName($tabLabel)));\n \nNow I want to apply some style changes:\n \n\t\t\t$sumRange\t= begCol . $dRow . ':' . endCol . $dRow;\n\t\t\t$styleArray\t= array(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'font' => array(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'color'\t=> PHPExcel_Style_Color::COLOR_RED,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'size'\t=> '20',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  );\n \n\t\t\tthis works:\n\t\t\t$xl->getActiveSheet()->getRowDimension($dRow)->setRowHeight(25.5);\n \n\t\t\tthese do not:\n\t\t\t$xl->getActiveSheet()->getStyle($sumRange)->applyFromArray($styleArray);\n\t\t\t$xl->getActiveSheet()->getStyle($sumRange)->getFont()->setSize('20');\n \nI don't get any error messages, but there is no change in the style attributes either.\n \nDoes anyone have any ideas why?\n \nThanks in advance.",
