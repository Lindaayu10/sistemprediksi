    "Description": "After someone else came and had a play with what I was working on the STDEV function seems to be giving me the problem.  I had been testing by calculating the standard deviation of 3 numbers that were the same, the number 3, in Excel this gives 0, in PHPExcel i get a #!DIV/0 error.  Seems to be from line 1888 in function STDEV in Functions.php, which is an if block:\n \n \n// Return\nif (($aCount > 0) && ($returnValue > 0)) {\n\treturn sqrt($returnValue / $aCount);\n}\n \nI was wondering about changing it to be:\n \n// Return\nif (($aCount > 0) && ($returnValue >= 0)) {\n\treturn sqrt($returnValue / $aCount);\n}",
