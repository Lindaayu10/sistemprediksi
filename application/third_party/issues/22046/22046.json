    "Description": "Hi,\n\nI've encountered a strange behaviour in some of my projects after updating to PHPExcel 1.8.0.\n\nWhen I assign the result of two subsequent calls to \"getCellByColumnAndRow()\" into different variables, both variables refers to the last cell requested.\n\nHere is a sample code to reproduce the issue  :\n\n```\nrequire 'PHPExcel.php';\n\n$excel = new PHPExcel();\n$sheet = $excel->getActiveSheet();\n\n$A1 = $sheet->getCellByColumnAndRow(0,1);\necho \"A1=\".$A1->getCoordinate(). \"\\n\"; // Should print \"A1\"\n\n$D9 = $sheet->getCellByColumnAndRow(3,9);\necho \"D9=\".$D9->getCoordinate().\"\\n\"; // Should print \"D9\"\n\necho \"A1=\".$A1->getCoordinate().\"\\n\"; // Should print \"A1\"\n```\n\nThe output I get is the following :\n\n```\nA1=A1\nD9=D9\nA1=D9\n```\n\nI've ran this code sample on PHP 5.2 and the latest 5.6. I get the same results.\n\nThank you",
