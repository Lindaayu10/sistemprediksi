      "Message": "A notable portion of questions/problems we are seeing are related to the Excel built-in number formats.\r\n\r\nWhile Excel5 and Excel2007 reader does read many of the built-in format codes these are translated to user-defined ones during the read process. This is to account for PHPExcel core not supporting built-in number format codes (0-163).\r\n\r\nThis works ok except for e.g. some of the locale dependent number formats which do not translate to a unique user-defined equivalent string.\r\n\r\nIs there some way we could incoorporate number format codes (0-163) in PHPExcel? I am aware this may not be easy!",

      "Message": "This looks like a major improvement! I did some tests and read/write from template works better with dates. Before, it would happen that a date like '31-03-2009' would change to '03-31-09' after a plain read/write, but no longer.\r\n\r\nPHPExcel only ships in one language version. Among other things this means that when you export to HTML or PDF dates and currencies may still not look like what you see when opening the workbook in MS Office Excel. I think you are right that we should wait doing more refinements until memory optimizations are in place. But now that built-in format codes have started to work ok imagination tells me that a locale feature request will one day come :')",
