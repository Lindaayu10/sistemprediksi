    "Description": "I have Excel spreadsheet with column which cells have embed URL address. When I load this spreadsheet and display that address in browser I can see some strange characters on the end of URL. For example, my address is \"http://www.domain.com/page.php?id=1\" and when I show in browser using this line of code $objWorkBook->getActiveSheet()->getCell('A1')->getHyperlink()->getUrl() it display like \"http://www.domain.com/page.php?id=1塹ᴻ䡿ⲯ嶂藄挧ꮥ\". I don't know where is the problem. I found class Hyperlink and method getUrl() but have no luck to find solution to this problem. Also I try to convert character encoding but that doesn't solve my problem. Does anyone knows what produce this strange behavior? Thanks in advance!",
