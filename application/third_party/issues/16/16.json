      "Message": "I came across the same problem - I needed charts in PHPExcel. What I did is I ported some changes from charts (wi16-graph branch) to work in 1.7.6 code. \r\nIt worked for OpenOffice but not for excel. I did some more research, learnt how much brain-damaged OpenXML is [http://www.codeproject.com/KB/XML/ooxml_is_defective.aspx]\r\nand produced something that works (at least with excel2010)\r\nIt's not complete, it only allows to save charts.\r\nHow to use:\r\n1. you have to have a chart template prepared (just create chart in excel and extract xl/charts/chart1.xml file).\r\n[code]\r\n    $objDrawing = new PHPExcel_Worksheet_ChartDrawing();\r\n    $objDrawing->setTemplate($template); //$template is string with original chart contents \r\n    $objDrawing->setWorksheet($worksheet);\r\n\r\n    // set some data\r\n    $objDrawing->setLabels($labelsRange=\"A1:A10\");\r\n    $objDrawing->setDataset($dataRange=\"B1:B10\",$dataArray); //$dataArray should have actual array values\r\n    $objDrawing->addDataset($anotherRange=\"C1:C10\",$actualDataArray);\r\n  // set cooridnates - must set both as positioning uses twoCellAnchor\r\n   $objDrawing->setCoordinates(\"D1\");\r\n   $objDrawing->setCoordinates2(\"E2\");\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nAnd thats all. I apologize for ugly code, but that was all functionality I needed at this time. Some things I got right though:\r\n1. Excel really needs calcChain.xml, so I generate one (PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007_ContentTypes, PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007_Rels,PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007)\r\n2. Charts needs its own relations and content types (PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007, PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007_ContentTypes, PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007_Rels)\r\n3. twoCell anchor works better for chart positioning that oneCellAnchor (PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007_Drawing, PHPExcel_Worksheet_BaseDrawing)\r\n\r\nThat patch is not a complete solution but some parts of it may be a start for future work.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
