    "Description": "Hi,\nI would like an alternative syntax for addressing a cell, (column number, row number) instead of present (column letter . row number)\nÂ \nIn a program it's natural to address cell one in a sheet as cell(1,1). But cell one is addressed A1, which means programs have to translate column number to a letter, in this case 1->A.",
