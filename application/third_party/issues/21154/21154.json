    "Description": "I have a hospital managment system and I need to create xls from web forms, I've done the work and everything seems to work fine, but the file says \"wrong file format\" when I try to import it.\nIf I open the file in excel and save it, without doing anything else, the size goes from 6kb to 22kb but now the file can be imported.\nI dont know why, I've tried cell format, column size to no avail \nIn the zip are the two files, the one generated by phpexcel and the same file, just after being opened and saved in excel.",
