      "Message": "Hello! It's for writing. We have a tool which generates consolidated reports. Data loads in a xml file (php smarty template) and then pass it to the excel writer. These reports populate data in many columns when it runs for a long date range. I'm guessing it might exceeding the limit of the column string index. I was looking at this function below in cell.php.\r\n\r\n```\n public static function columnIndexFromString($pString = 'A')\n\t{\n\t\t// Convert to uppercase\n\t\t$pString = strtoupper($pString);\r\n\r\n\t\t$strLen = strlen($pString);\n\t\t// Convert column to integer\n\t\tif ($strLen == 1) {\n\t\t\treturn (ord($pString{0}) - 64);\n\t\t} elseif ($strLen == 2) {\n\t\t\treturn $result = ((1 + (ord($pString{0}) - 65)) * 26) + (ord($pString{1}) - 64);\n\t\t} elseif ($strLen == 3) {\n\t\t\treturn ((1 + (ord($pString{0}) - 65)) * 676) + ((1 + (ord($pString{1}) - 65)) * 26) + (ord($pString{2}) - 64);\n} else {\n\t\t\tthrow new Exception(\"Column string index can not be \" . ($strLen != 0 ? \"longer than 3 characters\" : \"empty\") . \".\");\n\t\t}\n\t} \n```\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if there's a solution when it comes to \"strLen == 4\"? Or do we have any other way to fix this? \r\n\r\nYour help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nHeman\n",
