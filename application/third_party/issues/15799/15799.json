    "Description": "I'm using the latest SVN as of today at 1PM EDT.  On PHP 5.2.13 - Win Server 2003 - IIS.\n \nI have a fairly simple (in terms of formatting) Excel 2007 template file that I read into PHPExcel, add some data, and then write it back out.  I'm using Excel 2010 to view the file.\n \nIn the template XLSX, http://tysonandjulia.com/files/billing_sheet_template.xlsx, the \"background color\" for the whole sheet is \"No Color\" and the \"Pattern Color\" is \"Automatic\".  See screenshot of cell fille in template (good): http://tysonandjulia.com/files/template-good_fill_formatting.JPG\n \nIn the file that PHPExcel writes out, attached here, the \"background color\" for the whole sheet is *unset* (the \"No Color\" button is not \"activated\") and the \"Pattern Color\" is \"Black\".  See screenshot of cell fill in written file (bad): http://tysonandjulia.com/files/written_file_fill_formatting.JPG\n \nThe result of this is that, when you \"enter\" a cell to edit the contents, the background of the cell is black.  The text is also black, and you end up not being able to see what you're typing.  This behavior is present in every cell in the attached \"written\" xlsx.\n \nThe cause of this behavior is that the \"Background Color\" of the cells is unset instead of being set to \"No Color.\"  In the written file, as soon as you click the \"No Color\" button in Excel to set the fill to \"No Color,\" the cell behaves properly.\n \nI know it's not the writer's fault, because I can write out other very similar (same basic JSON data > XLSX output structure, just not with a template) XLSX files without this happening.\n \nI think the reader is perhaps misinterpreting something, and maybe it's something peculiar about my template file.\n \nThe code I'm using to read / write this file is here:  http://tysonandjulia.com/files/download_billing_sheet.txt\n \nLet me know if you want any more info.  PHPExcel rocks - thanks so much for creating and developing it.  I'm going to donate right after I finish typing this.",

      "Message": "More info:  I converted (using Excel 2010) the template file back to XLS Excel5.  I then modified my script with the only change being to read in the Excel5 XLS file.  I left the output as Excel2007.\r\n\r\nDoing this, the output Excel2007 file does not \"break\" with the black backgrounds during cell edits.  However, the output file's background color is still \"unset\" and the pattern color is still \"Black\".\r\n\r\nSee the attachment \"Excel5_template_-_Excel2007_output.xlsx\".\r\n\r\nThere is another error present, that I've noticed in these \"broken\" files too:  try editing the \"Unit Cost\" column, and look at the \"Extended\" Column.  When the \"Extended\" formula recalculates, the cell is not \"refreshed\" completely until you scroll it off the screen and back on.  Until you do that, the previous value and the new value both appear jumbled up together.  I don't know if these are all symptoms of the same problem, or what.",
