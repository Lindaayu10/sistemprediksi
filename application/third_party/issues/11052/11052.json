    "Description": "Some non-USA Excel versions are using different character than comma as an argument separator in formulas. In the developer documentation, there is description how to „4.4.4. Write formula into a cell“ including the example.\n \nI am proposing to add an example of writing formula which takes more than one argument to give people clear example, what is the argument separator.\n \nAn example of addition:\nPlease note that characters used as decimal, argument or matrix row separators must be written as in English localization, which can differ to your locale.\n$objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('C5', '=IF(C4>500,\"big amount\",\"small amount\")');\n \nI know that this could be considered as silly issue (mainly because this information is written in the paragraph above), but I think that it is everytime better to give users more ways to accept information. Code example is one of them.",
