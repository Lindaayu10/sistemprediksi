    "Description": "Hi All,\nI am facing the issue related to maximum execution time limit since the script is taking too long time to load the data into excel as it contains more than 45000 rows for two files. I got the error that 'maximum execution time of 240 seconds exceeded' and I think the time is taken by the following methods whichever I use, both are taking time.\nobjSheet->setCellValueByColumnAndRow($colIndex,$rowIndex, $data)\nor\nobjSheet->fromArray();\n\nThen I tried to increase the time limit by the following methods:\nini_set('max_execution_time',0); //set unlimited time\nor \nini_set('max_execution_time',12000); //set time for 20 minutes\n\nBut it runs for 5-7 minutes and gives the following error.\n\nRequest Time-out\nServer timeout waiting for the HTTP request from the client.  \n\nI tried to put the data in csv file. It is not taking any time.\n\nPlease tell me how to resolve this issue.\n\nThank you for your help.",
