      "Message": "I've tried generating a series of workbooks with frozen panes using the Excel2007 Writer, then opening them in both Excel2003 (with the compatibility pack) and Excel2010, but haven't seen any error. While the split is written without all the bells and flourishes that Excel uses, there shouldn't be any problems... however, if I extend the writer logic when I can't actually replicate the error, I'll be very dependent on you to test to see if any changes I make actually fix your problem.\r\n\r\nCan you please check which version of Excel (Help/About should tell you), and can you let me know which cell you're freezing on?",
