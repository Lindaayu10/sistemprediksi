It seem it's a bug.\n \nI'm trying to remove some rows with merged cells and i can't get it right.\n \nIt looks like merged cells don't get removed (I know merged cells are in separated array). Also data in cell get messed up (it removes some data I didn't want to be removed)\n \nI'm using Excel2007 for reading and writing and PHPExcel 1.7.6\n \nMore details with screenshots at http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/discussions/260613",
