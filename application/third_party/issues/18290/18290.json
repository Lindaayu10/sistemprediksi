    "Description": "DISCLAIMER: This really looks like a PHP issue (5.3.11 at least), not a PHPExcel issue (I'm going to open a case in the PHP bugtracker as well), but since this can have a potentially bad impact on PHPExcel, here it is:\n \nJust creating a PHPExcel instance like:\n \n$objPHPExcel = new PHPExcel();\n \nleaks ~50 file handles in the httpd process.\n \nIf PHPExcel is used heavily in a production environment things can get nasty pretty soon so here are my findings and a proposed patch.\n \nI traced the leak down to these 3 lines in PHPExcel_Autoloader::Load\n \nif ((file_exists($pObjectFilePath) === false) || (is_readable($pObjectFilePath) === false)) {\n  return false;\n}\n \nApparently using file_exists and/or is_readable within the Load method causes a file handle to be leaked forever in the httpd process.\n \nAssuming that PHPExcel is properly installed and all files are there, just commenting out the above lines prevents the leak.",
