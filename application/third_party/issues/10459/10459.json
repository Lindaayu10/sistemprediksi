    "Description": "In PHPExcel we already have support for hyperlinks to URLs. But in Excel it is also possible in a cell to insert a hyperlink to a local file.\n \nExamples of hyperlinks to local files:\n \nmyfile.txt\nmyworkbook.xls#Sheet!A1\n \nPHPExcel_Reader_Excel5 does not support reading such hyperlinks.\nPHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 does not support writing such hyperlinks.\n \nTest (plain read/write):\n----\n$file = 'hyperlink.xls';\n$reader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReaderForFile($file);\n$excel = $reader->load($file);\n \n$sheet = $excel->getActiveSheet();\nvar_dump($sheet->getCell('A1')->getHyperlink()->getUrl());\n \n$writer = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($excel, 'Excel5');\n$writer->save('write.xls');\n \nExpected result:\n----\nstring(10) \"myfile.txt\"\nwrite.xls contains hyperlink to local file\n \nActual result:\n----\nstring(0) \"\" \nwrite.xls contains broken/lost hyperlink to local file\nScreen shot: http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/6943/ss20090816034501.png\n \nEnvironment:\n----\nPHPExcel 1.7.0",
