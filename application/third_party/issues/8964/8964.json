That makes it a bit hard to debug your script.\n \nI have traced it to this part in PHPExcel/Shared/JAMA/utils/Error.php\n \nset_error_handler('JAMAError');\nerror_reporting(ERROR | WARNING);\n \nMark, I am not sure about the inner bolts and nuts here, can you help?",

      "Message": "I'm running into the same issue here as I noticed that I wasn't receiving any error messages after including PHPExcel.php.  I run my application with E_ALL and a PHP Fatal Error was occurring that I wasn't notified about because error_reporting was overridden by JAMA.  Also, my specific application isn't using it, but anyone who defined a custom error handler using set_error_handler would now have it overridden if they were using PHPExcel.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's the best workaround, but for now, I have commented out these 2 lines at the bottom of PHPExcel/Shared/JAMA/utils/Error.php:\r\n\r\nset_error_handler('JAMAError');\r\nerror_reporting(ERROR | WARNING);\r\n",

      "Message": "rbro - The current subversion source has these lines commented out as well, that was our temporary solution until I can upgrade the library from PHP4 to PHP5.... unfortunately, my time is going to be rather limited between now and May\r\n\r\nFor the moment, I'm focusing my attention on the remaining Financial functions and providing full documentation of the function library at the moment; but JAMA provides the core for many of the matrix/array functions, so I will be upgrading it to PHP5 and restructuring the error handling so that it throw errors back up to the main function logic, where they can be caught and handled without the need for a custom error handler. My target for that is the 1.6.7 release, so probably in May. In the interim, the commented out calls to change the error handling should prevent any problems.",
