    "Description": "From thread:\nhttp://phpexcel.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=63637\n-----------\n \nI get that error when trying to convert a .xls file to .csv with the following code:\n \n$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel5');\n$objPHPExcel = $objReader->load('test.xls');\n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'CSV');\n$objWriter->save('test.csv');\n \nFull stack trace:\n \n#0 Classes/PHPExcel/Reader/Excel5.php(2319): PHPExcel_Worksheet_PageSetup->setScale(0)\n#1 Classes/PHPExcel/Reader/Excel5.php(696): PHPExcel_Reader_Excel5->_readPageSetup()\n#2 - PHPExcel_Reader_Excel5->load('test.xls')\n#3 {main}\n  thrown in Classes/PHPExcel/Worksheet/PageSetup.php on line 338\n \n \nI'm pretty sure there is some junk data in the .xls file that is causing this\n(especially considering that opening the file in OpenOffice Calc and saving\nit again in the same format fixes the problem), however, I think such junk\ndata shouldn't cause a crash like this, as the PageSetup shouldn't be used\nfor anything in this case.\n \nOf course, is this is better handled in my application I'm prepared to fix it there\ninstead.\n \nAnd as the file that causes the error contains customer data I'm afraid I can't\npost it here, but I could send it to a developer. (as I've done before)\n \nAnd this is using latest changeset, 28241",
