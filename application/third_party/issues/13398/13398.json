    "Description": "Hi!\n \nI'm excited with the writer improvements that this release brings, but I'm having some problems.\nI've just switched to the 1.7.3b and when I ran an existing php script, the worksheet is generated correctly, but when I try to open on Excel 2007 an error showed up \"Excel found unreadable content\".\nFirst I thought it could be some incompatibility with my code and then I created a simple one:\n \n$excel = new PHPExcel();\n$excel->getActiveSheet()->setCellValueByColumnAndRow(0, 1, \"Test\");\n$excel->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('C3', 'aa');\n$excel->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('D3', 'bb');\n$objWriter = new PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5($excel);\n$objWriter->save('test.xls');\n$objWriter = new PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007($excel);\n$objWriter->setPreCalculateFormulas(false);\n$objWriter->save('test.xlsx');\nexit;\n \nExcel5 version it works ok!\nExcel2007 showed up that error \"Excel found unreadable content\".\n \nI have no idea what is it about.\nCould you please check it out?\nThank you so much.\nRegards",

      "Message": "@tflessak\r\nYou should really be cursing me for letting as serious a bug as this into a release. I'm annoyed at myself because I was focusing on the performance/memory issues of the writer to the point where I forgot the absolute basics of producing valid SpreadsheetML. Fortunately, you spotted it quickly, and I was able to implement a quick fix.\r\nMaarten has only limited access at the moment, but he'll be running a re-release tonight",
