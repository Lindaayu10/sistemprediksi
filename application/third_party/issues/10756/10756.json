    "Description": "Hi,\n \nthere are several characters which seem to be forbidden for a worksheet title, such as *, :, /, \\, ?, [, and ]\nThose characters cause a corrupt file in Microsoft Excel.\n \nExpected result:\n---------------\neither throw exception or replace invalid characters automatically (with underscore?)\n \nActual result:\n---------------\ntitle with invalid characters is accepted, which ends up in a corrupt file (which can still be opened)",

      "Message": "hm I don't really like the Exception, because it does not help. Maybe there should be a parameter which allows the method to replace invalid characters. Because you are only able to fix the title from outside, if you know the invalid characters. So you have to look into the method. This is not a good solution. What do you think?",

This is really a general question in PHPExcel.\r\n\r\nQuestion:\r\nWhen there is bad user input, such as $sheet->setTitle('Work*sheet')\r\nWhat is the best approach? Throw exception, or automatically correct input according to some rule set.\r\n\r\nWe have dealt with this type of situation in different ways in PHPExcel. Sometimes we correct the input, sometimes we throw an exception. For example, $cell->setValue('Bad UTF-8 data') does not throw an exception, but just strips bad characters.\r\n\r\nMaarten and Mark, any opinion?",
