      "Message": "Hi ovj92,\r\n\r\nThe first thing is to download all necessary files in order to the library works. PHPExcel only brings \"a kind of interface file\" but doesn't bring all the necessary files. \r\n\r\nAs far as I understand the style guide PHP, the file names must be built using the same name of the class is declared within. In the version of this library that I donwloaded, the files are different from those of the class containing names. Sometimes it was simply change capitalization in file names to match. \r\n\r\nI was using PHP with the Yii framework. I don't know how far Yii influenced the problem.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you want the library that I edited and used. I can not send it here (7 MB). I can send my library (corrected by myself) to your mail if you want.\r\n\r\nPlease excuse my limited English (Â¿are you spaniard?). \r\n\r\nRegards.",
