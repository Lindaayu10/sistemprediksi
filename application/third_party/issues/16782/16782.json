    "Description": "I sometimes get a 500 Internal Server Error, when parsing larger Excel2007 (.xlsx) files. It is a very weird bug because if I re-save the file in Excel sometimes the error goes away.\nI have been trying everything, from reconfiguring PHP, Apache, FastCGI, everything one can think of, but no luck. Until I finally came across a file that produced the error every time I tried to parse it, so I could locate where the goddamn bug is :).\nAnd I found it - the problem is when I set $objReader->setReadDataOnly(true);\nAs soon as I commented out this row everything worked fine. And if I uncommented it again, the problem repeated.\n \nI tried it on several different PHP-Apache-CentOS versions and I can say, the bug is not PHP-version-dependable.\n \nI hope you can reproduce the bug or have any idea why it happens. I saved the problematic file for debugging but can not upload it here, because it contains some personal information. I can send it to someone directly, along with my PHP function, if you need it.",

I did everything it said in tutorials and documentation but I just can not get it to work :(\r\n\r\nI tried adding this lines in all segments of the code (above, below $objReader->load() but it is ignored everytime.\r\n$cacheMethod = PHPExcel_CachedObjectStorageFactory::cache_in_memory;\r\nPHPExcel_Settings::setCacheStorageMethod($cacheMethod);\r\nOther methods also do not work. Do you have any advice for me? I have tried many tutorials and read documentation about this but nothing seems to work, my script uses the same amount of memory every time.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
