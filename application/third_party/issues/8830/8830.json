    "Description": "PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 which is based on PEAR Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer was originally dealing with the spurious non-proportional column widths as presented in MS Office Excel's user intercase. This affects the scaling of images.\n \nIn this work item we update PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 to use the proportional width unit as used be the other classes in PHPExcel.\n \nThe warping is illustrated by doing a plain file conversion (read/write) from xlsx to xls of a workbook containing one image laid over columns of varying widths.\n \nTest:\n----\n$reader = new PHPExcel_Reader_Excel2007();\n$excel = $reader->load('read.xlsx');\n \n$writer = new PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5($excel);\n$writer->save('write.xls');\n \nExpected result:\n---\nxls output is identical to xlsx input when viewed in MS Office Excel 2007\nhttp://img167.imageshack.us/img167/1551/readfw3.jpg\n \nActual result:\n---\nImage gets slightly narrower in output than in input\nhttp://img167.imageshack.us/img167/1200/writezw6.jpg\n \nEnvironment:\n----\nPHPExcel 1.6.5 (and latest source from SVN)",
