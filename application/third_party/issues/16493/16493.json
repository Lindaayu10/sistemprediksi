    "Description": "For this project I'm working on, I need to generate an Excel file in a specific way. This is the file I need to generate:\n \nhttp://medicalmarcom.com/downloads/USTwitterDocs.xls\n \nMeanwhile, this is the file I have been able to generate:\n \nhttp://www.medicalmarcom.com/heres-doctors-on-twitter-list/?doctorslist_link=USTwitterDocs.xls\n \n \nI created a full-functional Wordpress plugin to update the listing and also provide the ability to add new doctors to the list. I also needed to be able to update the original file. Instead of updating the file, I just imported the original file into the database and generated the file dynamically. However, I have not been able to get the autofilter to work. I set the range of cells like this:\n \n$excel->getActiveSheet()->setAutoFilter('A1:J' . $row);\n \nwith \"$row\" being the last row generated in the sheet (since the amount of rows varies on the entries in the database), but the autofilter still isn't being added.\n \nIs there something else that needs to be done? Am I doing it incorrectly?\n \nI read a different issue here that seems to indicate this feature works, but he was having issues generating a more advanced autofilter. This only needs to be a very simple autofilter, though, and I can't even get that.\n \nI have googled quite a bit on this issue and I haven't found anything related to my issue. Any help would be appreciated.",
