    "Description": "Hi,\nI have done my tests on the latest SVN code (92409).\nMy model contains conditional formatting rules (mef_conditionnelle.xlsx).\nWhen the rule is verified, my cell is red and cell format is 'percentage' (see screen.jpg).\n \nNow I load my model and I write it without any modification.\nConditional formatting rules are written. Red background is conserved but percentage cell format is lost (cell format is now 'standard')\n \nPHP code:\n// Read\n$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel2007');\n$objReader->setIncludeCharts(TRUE);\n$objPHPExcel = @$objReader->load('doc/mef_conditionnelle.xlsx');\n// Write\n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel2007');\n$objWriter->setIncludeCharts(TRUE);\n$objWriter->save('doc/output.xlsx');\n \nCould you correct it please?\nThank you.",

      "Message": "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI have the same problem with 1.7.9 and I'm not reading and editing an existing file, but creating a new .xlsx in PHPExcel. I did some digging around and came up with the following.\r\n\r\nThe conditional formatting doesn't remove or change the number format of the cells themselves. If you right click -> Cell Format you can see that the number format is still there as it should be.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that conditional formatting sets it's own number format (General by default), even if you don't ask it to, and applies it too all cells that match the rule. You can see it in the conditional format dialog. If all cells you apply the rule to have the same formatting, then you can set the number format in the conditional style array. In my case this isn't an option as my rule applies to cell with many different formats (alternate row colors).\r\n\r\nI tried reproducing the conditional formatting in Excel 2010 and I noticed that by default Excel won't select a number format for the rule which preserves the original cel format. But when you select a number format then there is no way do unselect it and Excel will apply that format to all cells that match the rule and ignore the original format. The only way to get rid of it is to delete the rule, make a new one and make sure you don't touch any of the number format options in the conditional formatting dialog.\r\n\r\nThe option of not setting a conditional number format doesn't seem to be available in PHPexcel. And the more I think about it, the more it seems the only reason one can do it in Excel is because of a bug in the interface.",
