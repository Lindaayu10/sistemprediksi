    "Description": "From thread:\nhttp://phpexcel.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=71259\n----\n \nIs there any reason that upgrading from 1.6.2 to 1.7.0 would almost double my file sizes, and is there anything I can do about that?\n \n----\nThe problem seems to be that PHPExcel stores one image for each occurrence of the image in the workbook. In a normal Excel file the image would only be stored once to reduce file size.\n \nHere is a plain read/write test of an Excel file created in MS Office Excel 2007 containing the same image 4 times:\n \nTest:\n----\n$file = 'read.xlsx';\n$reader = new PHPExcel_Reader_Excel2007();\n \n$excel = $reader->load($file);\n \n$writer = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($excel, 'Excel2007');\n$writer->save('write.xlsx');\n \nExpected result:\n----\nFile size of output is (approximately) the same as for input\n \nActual result:\n----\nInput: 168 KB\nOutput: 699 KB (~ 4 x 168 KB)\n \nNote:\n----\nWhen one opens the generated file \"write.xlsx\" in MS Office Excel 2007 and does a plain save, then file size drops as expected. See write-saved.xlsx\n \nEnvironment:\n----\nPHPExcel 1.7.0",
