    "Description": "On 10/09/2010 10:21, jfbarnes wrote:\n  \nI'm setting the default binder with the standard code (below) but it still doesn't seem to be recognising percentages or dates and formatting them correctly in the outputted Excel file. I don't know if I'm reading into what this should actually do wrong or not, but when trying the 29advancedvaluebinder test too, only the percentage is actually anything other than 'General' in the resulting excel file.\nShouldn't this be setting them to the number correct formats in the actual Excel 2007 spreadsheet?\nÂ \n  \nYou're right, the 29advancedvaluebinder test isn't working correctly because there is a problem with the AdvancedValueBinder. Numbers, Booleans, Nulls, Formulae and Percentage seem to be OK, as do times; but dates and date/times are failing. And I see that the code doesn't test for strings containing numeric values in scientific format such as 1.234e-5.",

      "Message": "It's called before any cells are set, and it seems to do something, just not the same as what happens when 29advancedvaluebinder.php is run.\r\n\r\nThe value I want to set is '12%'. Without the setValueBinder line of code, this is just placed into the excel spreadsheet as '12%' in the format 'general', as expected. With the setValueBinder code included, it recognises it as a percentage, but instead of the '12%' value with 'percentage' (which does happens when I run the test php), it is a 'general' with the value '0.12'.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? (Sorry for the confusing explanation!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJosh",
