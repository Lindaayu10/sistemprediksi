    "Description": "I am trying to upload and convert excel files generated with PHPExcel (latest version 1.7.6) to google docs. This works with .xls files but not with .xlsx files.\nFor xls files I use : \n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($this->excel_writer, 'Excel5');\nand for .xlsx : \n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($this->excel_writer, 'Excel2007');\n \nThe error I get in google docs is : \"The spreadsheet you are trying to upload is invalid.\" \n \nWhile looking around for a solution I noticed that the files posted as examples here : http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Examples (eg : http://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=PHPExcel&DownloadId=94244 or http://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=PHPExcel&DownloadId=94248 ) give the same error so I know the error is not from something in my code.\n \nIf you open any of the respective files with OpenOffice and \"resave\" them they are converted ok.",
