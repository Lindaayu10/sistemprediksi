    "Description": "It seems that output produced by at least the Excel2007 is affected by change in locale which I wasn't expecting. When the xlsx files created are opened in MS Office Excel one gets a warning message. This happens even for blank spreadsheets.\n \nSample code:\n \nsetlocale(LC_ALL, 'da_DK.utf8'); // when this line is removed, everything is ok\n \n$objPHPExcel = new PHPExcel();\n$ws = $objPHPExcel->getActiveSheet();\n$writer = new PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007($objPHPExcel);\n$writer->save(\"temp/test.xlsx\");\n \nProduced files have been attached (with and without Danish locale)\n \nMS Office Excel is pointing at an error in line 19 in the sheet1.xml file for the Danish test run:\n \n<pageMargins left=\"0,7\" right=\"0,7\" top=\"0,75\" bottom=\"0,75\" header=\"0,3\" footer=\"0,3\"/>\n \nFor the corresponding line without Danish locale one instead gets this:\n \n<pageMargins left=\"0.7\" right=\"0.7\" top=\"0.75\" bottom=\"0.75\" header=\"0.3\" footer=\"0.3\"/>\n \nOnly difference is that decimal separator is point rather than comma.\n \nNote: I can only reproduce error on systems where Danish locale is actually installed and thus available.\n \nEnvironment:\nPHPExcel: latest source from SVN (changeset 14393)\nApache / PHP 5.2.6 running on Linux.",
