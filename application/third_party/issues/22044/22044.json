    "Description": "I'm trying to get PHPExcel to coexist with a piece of software that has a misbehaving __autoload function -- specifically, if the __autoload() fails, it *exits* with an error message, so PHPExcel's autoloader never actually gets to run.  I worked around this by modifying PHPExcel's autoloader code to register itself before it registers the other autoloader.\n\nIf there's no pressing need to have PHPExcel's autoloader run last, would it be possible to change the registration order so that it runs first (and thereby plays better with software that was written for older versions of PHP where there was only one possible __autoload)?",
