    "Description": "In Excel formulas it is possible to have cell ranges involving names, e.g.\n \n=SUM(monkey:A6)\n \nHere monkey could refer to, say, $A$1:$B$4, so the sum would be over the cells A1:B6\n \nBut the calculation engine raises an error when it sees this kind\n \nTest (plain read/write):\n----\n$file = 'read.xlsx';\n$reader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReaderForFile($file);\n \n$excel = $reader->load($file);\n \n$sheet = $excel->getActiveSheet();\nvar_dump($sheet->getCell('E1')->getCalculatedValue());\n \nExpected result:\n----\nfloat(1014.2124)\n \nActual result:\n----\n_raiseFormulaError message is Formula Error: An unexpected error occured\nstring(4) \"#N/A\"\n \nEnvironment:\n----\nPHPExcel 1.7.0 (and latest source code)",
