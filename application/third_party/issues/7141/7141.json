    "Description": "It would probably be useful to be able to get the binary data returned in a variable. E.g.:\n \n$myExcelData = $objWriter->save();\n \nThen $myExcelData could be used to a) output it to the browser, b) save it to the disk, or c) save it to a database blob, etc.\n \nOf course currently a workaround would be:\n \n$objWriter->save('temporaryfile.bin');\n$myExcelData = file_get_contents('temporaryfile.bin',FILE_BINARY);",
