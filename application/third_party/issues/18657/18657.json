    "Description": "The Formula =\"±\"&(VALUE(RIGHT(D16,(LEN(D16)-1))))/4 returns a Not Yet Implemented error when trying to use the getCalculatedValue() function. The value of the Cell at D16 is \"±0.05\".\n \nThis is strange, because (VALUE(RIGHT(D16,(LEN(D16)-1))))/4 returns the correct value, and a string concat by itself works. I just can't put the two together. I've tried putting 'TEXT(...,\"General\") around the formula, and that works by itself, but not with a character concacted with it. \n \nI've tried using the CONCATENATE function instead of using the '&', and still get the Not Yet Implemented error. \n \nI can also put in a simple formula =\"X\"&(2/4) and that works\n \nWhat is is that is not implemented? I am confused, since the parts work separately.",

I'd suggest using that until we've implemented VALUE() in PHPExcel.",
