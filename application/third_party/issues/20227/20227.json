    "Description": "Hello.\n\nI am having an issue when trying to read inside an excel file.\nThe file in itself is pretty complexe, and I have spent quite a lot of time turning it into something more simple to narrow down the cause of the issue.\n\nHere is the error message I get:\n```\nCatchable fatal error: Argument 2 passed to PHPExcel_Calculation::extractCellRange() must be an instance of PHPExcel_Worksheet, instance of PHPExcel_CachedObjectStorage_Memory given, called in [.....]/Classes/PHPExcel/Calculation/LookupRef.php on line 429 and defined in [.....]/Classes/PHPExcel/Calculation.php on line 3687\n```\nThis is the excel formula I think (and I do emphasise on the fact that I am not really sure, but deleting the cells containing formulas such as this one creates a different error --> going one step further in correcting the problems ^^)\n```\n=IF(ISBLANK(D13);\"--\";VLOOKUP(B21;OFFSET(page9!I1;MATCH(D13;page9!$I$3:$I$122;0);1;12;2);2;FALSE))\n```\n\nIs my guess that this formula is going to create troubles true ? I read that the OFFSET function had some issues in the past...\nHas anyone encountered any thing such as this and, if so, managed to correct it?\n\nI am using phpexcel  1.7.9 on a linux server running PHP Version 5.3.24\n\nYou can find bellow an Excel file containing the formula above (and only it) which also generates this error.\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nRegards.",
