    "Description": "I tried to set the alignment for a cell range by using duplicateStyleArray(), but I found out, that I can't use 'wraptext' => true, but 'wrap' => true.\nSame thing with NumberFormat, the function is named setFormatCode() but the array expects only 'code'.\n \nIs there a list of valid index values which can be used in the style array? (and maybe their corresponding functions?)\n \nIt's not too urgent, since I already was able to find out the correct values, but I think it'might come in handy. :)",
