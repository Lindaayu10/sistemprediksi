    "Description": "I have a large sheet (415x314) which i import without styles using cache_to_apc to workaound my 128MB limit.\n \nI check several values and add a green background for all checked and a red for all errorous cells.\nThen i hide some rows and cols and output that to html.\n \nNow i see following. Using\n$xlsWriter = new PHPExcel_Writer_HTML($xls);\n$xlsWriter->save('php://output');\nor\n$xlsWriter = new PHPExcel_Writer_HTML($xls);\necho $xlsWriter->generateStyles();\necho $xlsWriter->generateSheetData();\n \ndoesn't work. Processing stops at the styles section without error (its no timeout, TO is set to 90s, processing stops around 70s. Sometimes elsewere within, sometimes at the end of the styles:\n[...]\ntable.sheet0 tr.row411 { height:15pt; display:none; visibility:hidden }\ntable.sheet0 tr.row412 { height:15pt; display:none; visibility:hidden }\n</style>\n \nBUT, if i use following:\n$xlsWriter = new PHPExcel_Writer_HTML($xls);\necho $xlsWriter->generateSheetData(); \t\necho $xlsWriter->generateStyles();\n \nthe code works like a charm.\n \nAny hints?\nDaniel",
