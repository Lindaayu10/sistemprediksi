      "Message": "First issue.... noted and fixed. Thanks!\r\nSecond issue.... should work, but can be quirky depending on how PHP was built against PCRE... the block of code in lines 39-52 is intended to handle UTF-8... originally tested with Kanji, I'll need to try it with Cyrillic. \r\nThird issue... it will happen, though it's a lot more than simply finding a new code repository. I want a new tracker, discussion board, etc where I can also put the PHPDocumentor docs online as well as have all the code examples as executable code too.",
