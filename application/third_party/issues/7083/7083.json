    "Description": "I am very glad to see that the PDF writer is really starting to mature for production use. One of the final hurdles I need to overcome before I can heavily benefit from PDF writer has to do with quirks involving cell height in conjuction with text wrapping.\n \nCurrent problems with PDF writer:\n \n1.\nHorizontal neighbor cells may end up having different height. For example, A1 and B1, may end up having different heights whenever the cells contain unequal amount of text (compare red, green, and blue cells in attachment)\n \n2.\nLine height problems. It looks like the line height being set is somehow based on the overall height of the left neighbor cell causing gaps between the lines. (look at line height in the blue cell in attachment)\n \n3.\nText wrapping control not implemented in PDF writer.\n \nWithout even knowing if it is possible, I suggest letting the PDF writer mimic the printed Excel document from MS Office Excel 2007. Consequently,\n \nText wrapping in each cell in the PDF should be determined by the boolean value as set using the setWrapText() method for the alignment object. This means that overflowing text may be truncated unless text is set to wrap, but cell height never expands with setWrapText(false). With setWrapText(true), all the cells in a row will expand in height as one puts in more text in the cell.\n \nEnvironment:\nPHPExcel: Latest source from SVN (change set 15344) 1.6.2+",
