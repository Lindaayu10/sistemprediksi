    "Description": "I've got an excel file containing a lot of cells and several charts. When loading it with reader, modifying it and saving it with writer, I've lost my chart. I guess charts are not loaded in object model. Do you have any workaround? Will this feature be supported in future releases?\nThank you for your help.\nRegards,\nDamien",
