It suggests that there is a discrepancy in the actual file itself for whatever reason: you get that error only if the first 8 bytes of the file don't match a recognised signature: if you were getting a permissions error or any other error, then it might be understandable; but that error will only occur if it is a different file that doesn't match the signature.",
