    "Description": "Try doing this :\n \nCreate a .xls file using Excel5 writer.\nTry opening (drag & drop) it in MSWord (i'm using msword 2007)\n=> You're prompt to convert the file\n \nNow copy this file, open it with MSExcel (i'm using msexcel 2007) and save it (no change)\nNow try opening (drag & drop) this file in MSWord\n=> no prompt, the file is inserted.\n \nI haven't had the time to try with CSV files on PHPExcel, but our old CSV builder has the same problem and the only difference between the files is line breaks.\nCan't tell if it's the same for Excel5 files.\n \nThe generated CSV file uses 0A as line breaks. The copied-then-saved CSV file uses 0D 0A as line breaks.\n \nIf i'm reporting this it's cause we have some people importing those files in their own software and they get an error. We've noticed that files working in their software work in word 2007, others prompt us to convert the file.\n \nThanks",
