    "Description": "Hi,\nI think is there a Bug in Calculation.php in this lines:\n \n801        if (strpos ( $pRange, ':' ) === false) {\n802            while ( is_array ( $returnValue ) ) {\n803                $returnValue = array_pop ( $returnValue );\n804            }\n805        }\n \nNow, with last Set (18152), I receive a blank page.\nIf I uncomment this line (like the previous version) everything it's ok!\nI think the problem is in the Revision 523, when you have commented the above lines.",

      "Message": "These lines were commented out so that the calculation engine would pass in the reference for a single cell as well as the value, so now the return value is always an array indexed by row and column even for single cell references, and not just for ranges.\r\nAs far as I'm aware, PHPExcel_Calculation->extractRange() is only called within PHPExcel from the PHPExcel_Calculation->calculate() method, and the actual Excel functions that require values all use a call to PHPExcel_Calculation_Functions::flattenArray() or PHPExcel_Calculation_Functions::flattenSingleValue() to extract the value(s) from that indexed array before executing the function code.\r\n\r\nIf you're calling PHPExcel_Calculation->extractRange() from within your own code, you might want to add a call to PHPExcel_Calculation_Functions::flattenSingleValue() immediately afterwards.\r\nOtherwise, can you send me an example of the code that you're using and I'll try and track through the logic to see why it can't accept a returned array.",
