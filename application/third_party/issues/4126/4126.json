    "Description": "First I want to thank the authors of this project for their really great work, thank you! \n \nThis item describes the problem that utf8 string is not converted to utf16, although setInputEncoding() is executed. This is because the writer will still check against _BIFF_version and will only perform conversion when it is version 8.\n \nAdding\n\"$workbook->setVersion(8);\"\nafter\n\"$workbook = new PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5_Writer($pFilename);\" (Writer/Excel5.php, line 82)\nshould solve this problem.",
