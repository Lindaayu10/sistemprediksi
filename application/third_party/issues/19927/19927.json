    "Description": "I am having trouble with the removeColumn function.\n\nI have a csv file with 100 rows and 100 columns. When I remove Columns 90-100, for some reason the data point at (column 100, row 1000) is not being removed. Every other cell of column 100 is removed except for the one of the very last row. \n\nHere is a basic example of the result. The 7 is left, however the rest of the column was deleted successfully. \n\nA    B \n1    2 \n3    4\n5    6   7\n  \nI have tested with various excel files and get the same result, therefore there is some issue with the classes. \n\nCould someone have a look at this?",
