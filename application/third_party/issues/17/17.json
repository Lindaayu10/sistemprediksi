We currently have excel report saved in the database that all use pivot tables to read from a hidden data sheet that we refresh on generation.  The users are use to being able to sort and filter with the pivot table headers.  I would love to get rid of these excel files and use PHP to generate this reports in whatever format the user selects.",
