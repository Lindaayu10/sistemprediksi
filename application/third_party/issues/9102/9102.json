But not all of the ones involving dates.\n \nIs there anything we can do to also improve reading capabilities of PHPExcel_Reader_Excel2007 with respect to built-in date number formats?\n \nFor reference, attached is an example of a workbook where date formatting does not pass through a plain read/write\n \nRelated work item:\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=7313",
