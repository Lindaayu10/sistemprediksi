    "Description": "I'm sorry if I'm not using the issues section correctly, but I couldn't find another way of asking if the #VALUE! error is a known bug. \n\nI get #VALUE! errors randomly when I read cells from an excel file. The error occurs on cells that reference other cells. I know that there is an issue if a cell is NULL, but in my worksheet the cells will NEVER be NULL.\n\nI created a xls workbook (eg KS0.xls)   - inside which there is a worksheet KS0-A that has the same format line after line; a concatenate function that references 4 columns\n(=CONCATENATE(\"Col E2: \",E244,\",      Col F2: \",F244,\",      Col G2: \",G244,\",      Col H2: \",H244))\n\ncols E, F, G, H have a simple function: =CHOOSE(RANDBETWEEN(1,3),\"OK1\",\"OK2\",\"OK3\"),\nso they will always have either OK1, OK2, or OK3\n\nThis is the output when I read the cells that have the concatenate function (as above): look at how #VALUE! appears randomly, suggesting there is a problem... My PHP is a simple loop that reads the lines row by row\n\nSTOP PRESS!!! I've just noticed that there is no OK1 in my output, and by laws of probability I guess that the #VALUE! errors are occurring when RANDBETWEEN(1,3) returns 1 (and so should pick OK1).... that is still a problem, but it may be a clue to a solution? Can anyone see what the problem is?\n\n__### LATEST ###: The problem is with the CHOOSE function; whenever the FIRST item is being asked for, the error #VALUE! results;__ \neg    =CHOOSE(1,\"A\",\"B\",\"C\") will result in #VALUE! error, \n  but =CHOOSE(2,\"A\",\"B\",\"C\") will result in \"B\"\n\nOutput on RUN 1\nType:CH1 __Q1: Col E2: OK3, Col F2: OK2, Col G2: #VALUE!, Col H2: OK3\nType:CH2 __Q2: Col E2: #VALUE!, Col F2: OK3, Col G2: OK2, Col H2: OK2\nType:CH3 __Q3: Col E2: OK3, Col F2: #VALUE!, Col G2: OK3, Col H2: OK2\nType:CH4 __Q4: Col E2: #VALUE!, Col F2: #VALUE!, Col G2: OK3, Col H2: OK2\n\nAnd when I run the php again i get:\n\nOutput on RUN 2\nType:CH1 __Q1: Col E2: #VALUE!, Col F2: #VALUE!, Col G2: OK3, Col H2: #VALUE!\nType:CH2 __Q2: Col E2: OK3, Col F2: OK3, Col G2: OK2, Col H2: #VALUE!\nType:CH3 __Q3: Col E2: OK3, Col F2: #VALUE!, Col G2: #VALUE!, Col H2: OK2\nType:CH4 __Q4: Col E2: OK3, Col F2: OK3, Col G2: OK2, Col H2: OK3\n\n\nfixed see: https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel/issues/258?source=cc",
