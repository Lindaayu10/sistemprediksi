The problem with those strange squares is that it corrupt's my .xls file. I've tried to place functions like htmlentities, just to try things out but nothing worked, besides that I've been looking for a solution for this problem with google for 2 hours, with no result at all... Is there anyone who can help me?<br>\r\n",
