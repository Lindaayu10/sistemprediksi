And I was wondering if it is possible to get nicer time format out of PHPExcel. <br />\n<br />\nTime example : <br />\nOne of the time outputs I get is 0.83333333333333 which should represent 20:00 on a 24hour clock. <br />\nI figured out an math formula that converts it back to a 24hour clock (0.83333333333333 * 0.24) * 100. <br />\n<br />\nDate example :<br />\nOne of the date outputs I get is 41382, which should represent 4/18/2013 (MM-DD-YYYY), but for that one I still have to figure out an math formula.<br />\n<br />\nBut are there any settings to have a more friendly ouput ? Or an different kind of output ?<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n<br />\n[Edit]I meant an excel 2007 file[/edit]<br />\n",
