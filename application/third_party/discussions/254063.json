We are running a Linux VPS, 2GB of RAM, FCGI with APC and increased server settings to rediculous\r\n amounts:</p>\r\n<p><strong>max_execution_time = 200000</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>max_input_time = 200000</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>memory_limit = 512M</strong></p>\r\n<p>Using a file with about 12,000 lines (2.4MB file), but only when I decrease the amount to 2,000 or so does it go through. Otherwise, I get the following error:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Warning: fread() [function.fread]: Length parameter must be greater than 0 in/home/usr/public_html/libraries/phpexcel/Classes/PHPExcel/CachedObjectStorage/PHPTemp.phpon line 98</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Fatal error: Call to a member function attach() on a non-object in/home/usr/public_html/libraries/phpexcel/Classes/PHPExcel/CachedObjectStorage/PHPTemp.phpon line 100</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Fatal error: spl_autoload() [&lt;ahref='function.spl-autoload'&gt;function.spl-autoload&lt;/a&gt;]:Class JFactory could not be loaded in/home/usr/public_html/libraries/joomla/session/storage/database.php online 84</strong></p>\r\n<p>Any help would be EXTREMELY appreciated as I and my data center are at our whit's end here.
