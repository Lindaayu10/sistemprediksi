I load the spreadsheet with the reader class, edit the content, and&nbsp; then save it. But after it is saved, the colors doesnt match with the original one i created..No error is reported.. I think this is just a bug of phpexcel..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote : i'm using ms excel 2007 to save the spreadsheet (save to excel5/ *.xls) , but dont know whether it is compatible or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThx so much.. \r\n",
