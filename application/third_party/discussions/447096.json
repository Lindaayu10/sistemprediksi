I'm so sorry for opening another discussion but I need to.\r<br />\n<br />\nLWol tried to help me and he has really been helpful in constructing the export page and it works well accept that the whole data is exported. And I think he is busy those days. I want to thank him again here. But what I need to be done is <strong>exporting the filtered results</strong>.\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>WHERE AM I NOW?</strong>\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1-</strong> I prepared a page in dreamweaver to display a filterable table and I added a form below (lines 316-324) with 3 hidden fields  and a button to go to &quot;exportXLS.php&quot; when clicked.\r<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5326510/C74tables.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5326510/C74tables.php</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nAnd this is the query I have:<br />\n<pre><code>SELECT *\nFROM satislar\nWHERE satis_satici LIKE v3 AND satis_tarih between v1 and v2\nORDER BY satis_tarih DESC</code></pre>\n\n<strong>2-</strong> The &quot;exportXLS.php&quot;, as you can check from the link below, exports all the rows not the filtered results.\r<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5326510/exportXLS.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5326510/exportXLS.php</a>\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Please, please help this novice in the bog. (A full export page would be really great indeed)</strong><br />\n",
