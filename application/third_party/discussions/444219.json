    "Html": "I have a PHP script that creates a XLS file for download and worked fine (IIS, PHP 5.4, Win7). Without any code change, suddenly Excel 2010 complains that the file is corrupt.\r<br />\n<br />\nI first suspected some change in the underlying data caused the problem. But then I tried 01simple-download-xls.php (test script) with the same result. I found another older post about problems with sending the xls to the browser and yes: If I save the file locally, everything is ok.\r<br />\n<br />\nI also tried 01simple-download-xlsx.php (Excel 2007 format): same problem.\r<br />\n<br />\nI can only guess that either a PHP upgrade or some Excel patch (making it more picky) cause the problem. LibreOffice can open the file just fine. But if I save it as ODS and then open that in Excel, Excel complains about invalid data (but is able to recover the document).\r<br />\n<br />\nYou can find all files (XLS downloaded to browser, locally saved XLS, and also the slightly modified test scripts (for making them create identical XLS files)) here:\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.polivox.ch/phpExcelTests.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.polivox.ch/phpExcelTests.zip</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nI would really appreciate some help in this, hoping that you can make this excellent project even better!\r<br />\n<br />\nBR, Oliver<br />\n",

    "Html": "PHP version: there were security updates performed. Don't think this is the problem.\r<br />\n<br />\nOpening files: You are right. If I open the file from the ZIP archive I published, it works fine in my Excel 2010. This brought me to the root cause: If I go to the downloaded XLS file properties and (under Security) Unblock the file, it opens fine in Excel. (This information is removed when you add a file to a ZIP archive.)\r<br />\n<br />\nSuspected background: I use SSL (HTTPS). The certificate expired recently and so far I haven't replaced it. In Firefox, I simply created a security exception and Firefox was happy. I guess Excel checks the &quot;origin&quot; of &quot;downloaded&quot; files and refuses to open them if the certificate is expired (or invalid in general)...\r<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks for your swift response and thanks again for this great tool!\r<br />\n<br />\nBR, Oliver<br />\n",
