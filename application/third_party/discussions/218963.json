This directory change altered the include I need to do to include the base class PHPExcel.php because there is now an extra PHPExcel directory (changed from /usr/local/lib/php/PHPExcel.php to /usr/local/lib/php/PHPExcel/PHPExcel.php).\r\n\r\nIs this an intentional change that will remain for future releases?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\nRyan\r\n",
