With the chunked reader code in the wiki I've been able to reduce the memory footprint from 1GB+ to 28MB but I still have execution time issues. In my reasonably fast developer box, it still needs more than one minute to load a couple of rows (i.e., 22 cells). This time remains constant when I load 10 or 100 rows. Am I doing something wrong or is that the expected processing time?\r<br />\n<br />\nMy code is:<br />\n<pre><code>$filename = '/path/to/test.xlsx';\n\n$chunkFilter = new chunkReadFilter();\n$chunkFilter-&gt;setRows(2, 1);\n\n$oReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReaderForFile($filename);\n$oReader-&gt;setReadDataOnly(true);\n$oReader-&gt;setReadFilter($chunkFilter);\n$oPHPExcel = $oReader-&gt;load($filename);\n</code></pre>\n\n... where chunkReadFilter is copied from <a href=\"https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel/blob/develop/Documentation/markdown/ReadingSpreadsheetFiles/03-Loading-with-a-Reader.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reading Spreadsheet Files</a>. So far I'm not doing anything else, just <code>load()</code>.\r<br />\n<br />\nMy specs: PHPExcel/1.7.9 + PHP/5.5.8 on Windows 7<br />\n",
