    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nPHP and PHPExcel setup:\r<br />\nOS: OSX Maverick Development (Production Ubuntu 12.04)\r<br />\nPHP: 5.4.24\r<br />\nPHPExcel version: 1.7.9, 2013-06-02\r<br />\n<br />\nWe use PHPExcel to generate reports with graphs. Most of the graphs are line charts. These work well on Excel in Win and Mac. \r<br />\n<br />\nBut after upgrading to the latest Excel (2013) the graph reports don't work. Excel shows an error saying: \r<br />\n'We found a problem with some content in [name of the file].xlsx. Do you want us to try to recover as much as we can? If you trust the source of this workbook, click yes.'\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen the user clicks on Yes, next dialog says &quot;Removed Part: /xl/drawings/drawing1.xml part. (Drawing shape)&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nI tried to upload the generated file into the online Office provided by MS. It says it cannot open because the file is corrupted. But it opens fine on my Excel 2011.\r<br />\n<br />\nThen I proceeded to open the file in Excel 2011 and click save without changing anything. Then tried to open it in the online Office provided by MS. It opens without issues.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there something I can do to fix it?\r<br />\nIs there a way to know what is the difference between the two files before and after I clicked Save in the Excel 2011?\r<br />\n<br />\nIf I extract the Excel files and find the diff between the file: [Content_Types].xml here is what I can find: <a href=\"http://www.diffchecker.com/3b0sy53s\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.diffchecker.com/3b0sy53s</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nIf you need diff from another file to find the problem, please let me know.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you.<br />\n",
