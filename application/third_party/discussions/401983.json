    "Html": "\r\n<p>If the worksheet contains the data that you expect, then you really shouldn't worry about this. 4MB isn't particularly large for a file.</p>\r\n<p>PHPExcel is not a file editor: it doesn't simply add a few extra cells into the original file that might simply add a few bytes to the resultant size. It loads the file, converting its content to a PHPExcel object; you modify that PHPExcel object; and when\r\n you save, it writes a new file from the content of that PHPExcel object. Excel itself has a lot of different options for the way it stores the spreadsheet data, and the resources to optimise to store them extremely efficiently when it saves. PHPExcel stores\r\n in a generic manner, without the overhead of determining how best to optimise the resultant file to a minimal size. PHPExcel may, for example,&nbsp;save additional default styles that aren't used in the workbook, whereas Excel itself may discard these. You\r\n don't mention which format you're using: .xlsx or .xls... the former is zip compressed; but the zip compression method used by ZipArchive may not match the compression method used by Excel.</p>\r\n<p>So there's a whole host of factors that come into play that affect the size of a saved file: what's generally more important is that the content is correct.</p>\r\n",
