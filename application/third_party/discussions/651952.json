Including it is completely different via the bootstrap, and it's all namespaced. While some classes and methods are similar to existing 1.8 classes/methods, everything is subject to name change, while a lot of classes and methods are being refactored into smaller, more testable components. Idiosyncracies of existing PHPExcel (such as the discrepancies between column numbers and addresses) are being cleaned up, Reader/Writer names are being changed to match the format names (BIFF, OASIS, OfficeOpenXML, etc).\r<br />\n<br />\nIt's currently undergoing a complete rewrite It is likely to be moved into its own repository as PHPSpreadsheet before too long, but it shouldn't be used at present, certainly not for anything other than experimentation.<br />\n",
