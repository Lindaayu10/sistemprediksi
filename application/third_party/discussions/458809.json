I read that the OFFSET function had some issues in the past...<br />\nHas anyone encountered any thing such as this and, if so, managed to correct it?<br />\n<br />\nI am using phpexcel  1.7.9 on a linux server running PHP Version 5.3.24<br />\n<br />\nThanks a lot.<br />\n<br />\nRegards.<br />\n",
