I literally did copy-paste the code from <a href=\"https://github.com/cystbear/PHPExcel/blob/master/Tests/01simple-download-xlsx.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">this example</a>. But it doesn't work. I fixed the path in require_once, but the issue is somewhere else.<br />\nThe xlsx file is generated corerctly - when I save ot on the server, I can open it. It is also sent to the browser - firebug's console shows some funny characters in output window. The headers are also correct.<br />\n<br />\nBut no <em>Save as...</em> dialog is shown. I did some basic checks based on google search results - I have no extra white space after <code>?&gt;</code>. The only difference in my code is that I call <code>php</code> script from jQuery's <code>$.post</code> function with some additional arguments. Could it be the reason why I can't download this file?<br />\n<br />\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!<br />\n<br />\nPHP version: 5.4.20<br />\nPHPExcel version: 1.8.0<br />\nServer: Apache/2.4.6 (Linux/SUSE)<br />\n",
