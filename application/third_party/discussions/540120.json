( the page is blank).<br />\nI was checking and the problem seems to be with the instruction &quot;save('php://output');&quot;<br />\nbecause I can download the file to my machine by example &quot;save('/p.xlsx');&quot; .<br />\nIt only occurs when I execute the second php called from other php, \r<br />\nusing the method POST ( I can call to second using href=.... and it runs well and download the file).  But I need to do it with POST\r<br />\n<br />\nPlease if antbody knows the solution I will be very gratefully because I need resolve that urgently<br />\n",
