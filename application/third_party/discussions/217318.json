I've stripped my spreadsheet down to just coloured cells. If I remove any more rows or columns the error stops occurring. It's a really odd bug.</p>\r\n<p>Here's the code I'm using the replicate the issue:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>&lt;?php\r\n<span style=\"color:blue\">require_once</span>(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'./PHPExcel/Reader/Excel2007.php'</span>);\r\n$excel_reader_2007 = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> PHPExcel_Reader_Excel2007();\r\n$excel = $excel_reader_2007-&gt;load(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'Kings Place.xlsx'</span>);\r\n<span style=\"color:blue\">echo</span> count($excel-&gt;getSheetNames());\r\n<span style=\"color:blue\">die</span>();\r\n?&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\nAnd you'll see the result as 2, instead of what it should be, which is 1.
