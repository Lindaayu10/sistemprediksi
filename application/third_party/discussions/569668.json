And we needed to enable (comment out the ;extension=php_zip.dll line in php.ini) the zip extension manually. Latest version, since PHP 5.3.0, includes this zip support in core and it is enabled by default.<br />\n<br />\nI rode <a href=\"http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=FAQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> that since 1.7.6 the PCLZip library has been bundled with PHPExcel as an alternative to the ZipArchive class, that's why I used it.<br />\n<br />\nEverything works fine on WAMP.
