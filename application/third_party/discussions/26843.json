Is there an easy way to go about doing this?<br /><br />Maybe this is a post for the feature request area, but it would be nice to have a:<br /><br />$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;freezePane('top'); //or<br />$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;freezePane('left');<br /><br />or something to that effect.<br /><br />Anyone have any ideas?<br /><br />Thanks a bunch for all of your help<br /><br /><br />",

I have also put $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;freezePane('A1') in a loop to freeze all cells from A1 to ZZ1 with the same result.<br /><br />Thanks again for the time and effort.<br />",

In order to freeze row 1, I have to do:<br />$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;freezePane('A2');<br /><br />The same is true for the columns, in order to freeze column A, I have to do:<br />$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;freezePane('B1');<br /><br />So, combining the two in order to freeze both row 1 and column A, I have to do:<br />$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;freezePane('B2');<br /><br /><br />Not certain if this is by design or not, but this seems to do the trick.<br /><br />Thanks again for the help. <br /><br /><br /><br />",
