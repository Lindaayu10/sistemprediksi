These files were 134MB each and quickly filled up your [/tmp] directory. We can increase the size of your [/tmp]\r\n partition, however first we wanted to ensure that any code you might be running using PHPExcel is not incorrectly configured causing such large cache files. If there is something configured incorrectly raising the [/tmp] partitions usable disk-space could\r\n lead to further issues of that just filling up as well.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff\">Please review your usage of PHPExcel in your scripts and let us know if you expect these large cache files to consistently fill up your [/tmp] partition.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Here is the code I use in my scripts:</span></span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>    set_include_path(get_include_path() .

Nor does everybody have APC or memcache enabled, and these also have limitations on the amount of memory available, but they are also good for reducing the memory used by large workbooks (though I find memcache too slow on my servers... others may not have that problem). For my production environments, PHPTemp is the best method for me (with a 256MB base memory), but I have complete control of my production servers, and lots of memory. On the development box where I'm typing this, APC is the best.</p>\r\n<p>Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks, and each trades off memory against speed in different proportions. If you run from the CLI, and speed isn't critical to your application, then diskISAM is a reasonable choice. Running from Apache, APC or memcache might be better.</p>\r\n<p>I don't know your server circumstances, or the requirements of your applications/users; so I can't advise you which method is best for you. That's why I provide the range of different methods, so that you can make your own choice.</p>",
