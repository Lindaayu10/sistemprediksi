The thing is that the calculations in the sheet dont seem to be updating, however when i output the sheet to an xls file they work fine.  I was wondering if there was a method that I havent found to force the spreadsheet to update?  Ive tried turning the calculation caching off but it doesnt seem to help.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Im using PHPExcel 1.7.3c, PHP 5.3.2-1ubuntu4.2 and ubuntu 10.04</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks :)</p>\r\n\r\nA pared down version of my code looks like this, its actually quite a bit longer but these are (I hope) the pertinent bits:\r\n<pre>\r\n//call function in my code to go and create basic phpexcel spreadsheet\r\nfunction make_spreadsheet(){\r\n$excel = new PHPExcel();\r\n\r\n//add some vales and formulae\r\n$excel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValue('B1', $cell-&gt;value);\r\n...\r\n\r\nPHPExcel_Calculation::getInstance()-&gt;clearCalculationCache();\r\nreturn($excel);\r\n}\r\n\r\n//function where I add more to the sheet\r\n\r\nfunction use_spreadsheet(){\r\n//get basic spreadhseet\r\n$excel = make_spreadsheet();\r\n\r\n//add more numbers to spreadsheet\r\n$excel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValue('B2', $cell-&gt;value);\r\n...\r\n\r\nPHPExcel_Calculation::getInstance()-&gt;clearCalculationCache();\r\n\r\n//get a calculated answer\r\n$calcAnswer = $excel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getCellByColumnAndRow($c, $r)-&gt;getCalculatedValue();\r\n\r\n// $calcAnswer is incorrect - not been updated\r\n\r\n//using the following the spreadsheet outputs correctly\r\n$objWriter = new PHPExcel_Writer_EXCEL5($excel);\r\n$objWriter-&gt;save(str_replace('.php', 'grading.xls', __FILE__));\r\n\r\n}\r\n</pre>",

I figured there might be something obvious that i was missing.&nbsp; After someone else came and had a play with what I was working on the STDEV function seems to be giving me the problem.&nbsp; I had been testing by calculating the standard deviation of 3 numbers that were the same, the number 3, in Excel this gives 0, in PHPExcel i get a #!DIV/0 error.&nbsp; Seems to be from line 1888 in function STDEV in Functions.php, which is an if block:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>\t<span style=\"color:green\">// Return</span>\r\n\t\t\t<span style=\"color:blue\">if</span> (($aCount &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; ($returnValue &gt; 0)) {\r\n\t\t\t\t<span style=\"color:blue\">return</span> sqrt($returnValue / $aCount);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>I was wondering about changing it to be:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>\t<span style=\"color:green\">// Return</span>\r\n\t\t\t<span style=\"color:blue\">if</span> (($aCount &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; ($returnValue &gt;= 0)) {\r\n\t\t\t\t<span style=\"color:blue\">return</span> sqrt($returnValue / $aCount);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Im not sure if thats bad form in maths but its consistent with excel and open office?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Steve</p>",
