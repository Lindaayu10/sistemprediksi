Then I wrote some more data in it with a PHP script and export this file again.<br>\r\nI read the file with Excel 2003 because it is the only software we have as standard here.<br>\r\nAnd there is an error concerning the conditional formatting: <br>\r\n&quot;<br>\r\nThis file was created in a newer version of Microsoft Excel. The file has been converted to a format you can work with but the following issues were encountered. The file has been opened in read-only mode to protect the original file.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Some cells contain types of conditional formatting that are not supported in this version of Excel.<br>\r\n&quot;<br>\r\nThen the conditional formatting is not working in Excel2003. The funny thing is that the conditional formatting in the template is working when I open it with Excel2003. Do you have any ideas how to solve this issue?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you!<br>\r\nLudo<br>\r\n",

    "Html": "Not sure about this one as I have not worked much with conditional formatting. Sounds like Excel2007 writer is writing some extra data which is not needed, but which makes MS Office Excel 2003 choke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you possibly try to cut the problem down to simplest possible spreadsheet still showing the error and upload the file somewhere? E.g. just a single cell with conditional formatting. Then maybe some of us can do some tests. Also, do you see the error after a plain read/write using Excel2007 reader/writer without adding any data?<br>\r\n",
