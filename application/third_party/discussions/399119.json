I trimmed the whitespace from the start of the file.Mind the backslashes before the quotes in the code;its\r\n a file written dynamically from php as a string its not faulty.</p>\r\n<p>Yeah and php version is 5.3.8 and PHPExcel 1.7.4 or 1.7.7 anyway the one without the charts support. That code used to work i dont know what happened now.</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>Thanks for replying. This code is part of a fwrite calling parameter hence the backslashes (It is a string, i forgot to leave the slashes off when pasting the code here). Adding an exit call as the tests file shows doesnt work for me .Do we have to explicity set metadata like creator, etc? The request and response are working fine and i can see them in firebug but i wont get a prompt for downloading. The response is binary. I can see in my mysql log that the queries to the db have been executed correctly. I am working on linux and tried with oasis format to set the headers in client and server in case phpexcel wont render a correct file because no ms excel is available but that doesnt work either. Any other advice Mark?</p>",
