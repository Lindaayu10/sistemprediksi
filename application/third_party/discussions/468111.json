    "Html": "Hi All,<br />\n<br />\nI've got a site that generates spreadsheets, and I'm trying to move it to using PHPExcel (and generate XLSX files).  I am using v. 1.7.9, and my staging site is hosted on my Mac using MAMP Pro.  (If it matters, I loaded PHPExcel using Composer and I am using NetBeans as my development environment)<br />\n<br />\nProblem is, I keep getting a file that doesn't load/display in Excel (2011 for Mac if it matters).  When I check the error log, I see the following:<br />\n<br />\nUncaught exception 'PHPExcel_Writer_Exception' with message 'Could not close zip file php://output.' in [web root]/vendor/phpoffice/phpexcel/Classes/PHPExcel/Writer/Excel2007.php:348<br />\n<br />\nSo I went back and tested one of the simple examples (01simple-download-xlsx.php) and got the same results.<br />\n<br />\nA google search shows that this can be a problem with folder permissions, but I am writing to php://output so I am not sure that's the issue.  I walked through the code with the debugger and in the line that throws the exception, I see that the filename member of the $objZip object (A ZipArchive object) is &quot;[web root]/vendor/phpoffice/phpexcel/Examples/php:/output&quot;, so I went to the Examples folder and made sure everybody had read/write permissions, but the error persists.<br />\n<br />\nI'm sure that it's just something I'm missing (I see so many people using it without issue) but not sure where to look next. <br />\n<br />\nAny suggestions or a kick in the right direction?<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n<br />\nFOLLOWUP: <br />\n<br />\nI think I have resolved this issue myself.  Turns out that the webserver did not have rights to the system temp folder (hence the funny filename in the ZipArchive object).  When I rectified that, it came to life.<br />\n<br />\nHopefully we can leave this post here so others that might have the issue can be helped.<br />\n",
