    "Html": "<p>Cyclic references are when a formula in one cell references a cell containing another formula which contains a reference to the first cell, though the chain can be across several cells. MS Excel has two different ways of handling such formulas, as does PHPExcel. Try setting cell A1 in a worksheet to formula =B1+1, and cell B1 to a formula =A1+1; then change the calculation options to Enable Iterative Calculation&nbsp;and play with the Maximum Iterations Count (File/Options/Formulas/Calculation options in MS Excel 2010) to see the alternative effect.</p>\n<p>The first (default) option is to throw an exception. This is what's happening here; and mirrors MS Excel's default option of displaying an error message if you try to enter a cyclic formula. To process in this way, use a try/catch block to identify such errors when a formula is calculated (such as when you save a file), and use your own error handling.</p>\n<p>The second option, is to calculate the formula through 1 or more iterations of the cycle. To enable this, use:</p>\n<p>PHPExcel_Calculation::getInstance()-&gt;cyclicFormulaCount=n;</p>\n<p>where n is the number of iterations to allow ( n &gt;= 1)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
