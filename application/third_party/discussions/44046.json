    "Html": "The file was originally created in excel 2000, on Windows XP.&nbsp; One of our clients imported some data into it.&nbsp; I am not sure how he entered the data, because the dates were stored as strings, not integers.&nbsp; The data was copied to our new import file, the sales person insists on sending the old import file format, but that's a whole different issue.&nbsp; This new file was created in excel 2007, the data copied, and saved as an .xlsx.&nbsp; After the data was in the new file, we noticed the dates.&nbsp; I had to double click on each cell and hit enter to change them to excel dates from the string.&nbsp; I don't think it was ever touched by a Mac, as the dates are not off by four years only one day and the &quot;use 1904 date system&quot; was never checked.&nbsp; I do have access to a Mac, at home, with office 2008 on it.&nbsp; I would be happy to create some excel files for testing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is some more info about the issue, for most of the excel files this code works:<br>\r\ndate_format(date_create('@'.PHPExcel_Shared_Date::ExcelToPHP($temp)), 'm/d/Y')<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere $temp is the value of the cell, for dates its an integer.&nbsp; However with this file, the dates outputted were all wrong, this is actually what lead me to use the HTML writer.&nbsp; I figured it knew how to handle the date fields better then I did. But it turns out that I could use this code instead and get the correct dates:<br>\r\ndate_format(date_create('@'.$temp), 'm/d/Y')<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the first line of code the excel date of 1/1/1973 comes out as 1/24/2026<br>\r\nWhere as the other line, the excel date of 1/1/1973 comes out as 1/1/1973<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the exact same file the HTML writer still outputs 12-31-72, I just double checked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
