Its getting there but I discovered some strange behavior when doing some testing using a formula that includes variables from a different sheet. \r<br />\n<br />\nFor example, I have the following formulas:<br />\n<pre><code>=IF($A3=&quot;Diåmeter&quot;;MATCH($B6;Uträkning!$C1:$C6;0)*MATCH($B4;Uträkning!$D1:$D6;0); -1)\n\n=IF($A3=&quot;Beräkning&quot;;MATCH($C3;Variabler!$B1:$B6;0)*MATCH($C4;Variabler!$C1:$C6;0); -1)</code></pre>\n\nThe first one works, the second one does not. (The name &quot;diåmeter&quot; is intentional) \r<br />\nThe first formula is taking values from the same sheet as the second formula and vice versa. \r<br />\nHowever, the sheet named &quot;Variabler&quot; is first in order, and &quot;Uträkning&quot; is second. \r<br />\nIf I change the order of the sheets, and then change &quot;setActiveSheetIndex()&quot; accordingly, then the first one fails (resulting in #N/A) and the second one fails.\r<br />\nIt seems like I can only collect variables from sheets having a higher indexnumber than the sheets Im working in.\r<br />\nWhy is that?  <br />\n",
