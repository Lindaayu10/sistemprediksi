I'm using a Unix timestamp (stored in $timestamp) which corresponds to 2010-01-29 00:00.</p>\r\n<p>I have tried putting the Unix timestamp in manually and formatting the cell, like so:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;SetCellValueByColumnAndRow(3, $currentrow, $timestamp);\r\n$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getStyleByColumnAndRow(3, $currentrow)-&gt;getNumberFormat()-&gt;setFormatCode(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'dd/mm/yyyy'</span>);\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\nHowever, if I open the spreadsheet in OpenOffice the value is 04/07/-8814 and in Excel 2007 ##### is shown (the timestamp appears in the formula bar), even though the cell type shows as Date.</p>\r\n<p>I have also tried converting the timestamp to a string and not bothering with formatting, using the following code:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<pre>$date = date('d/m/Y', $timestamp);\r\n$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;SetCellValueByColumnAndRow(3, $currentrow, $date);</pre>\r\nThis works in Excel (cell type is General so I'm not sure if sorting will work), but in OpenOffice the cell value is '29/01/2010 - i.e. there is a quote mark before the date.</p>\r\n<p>Am I doing something wrong, or is this a known bug with dates? Ideally I would like to add the timestamp and format the cell as a Date, because that way sorting should work in the spreadsheet.</p>",

This means that there is no way for you to set a cell date/time value for a specific timezone... it's whatever timezone you want it to be. Without\r\n knowing exactly what you want to achieve, it's difficult to advise you any further.</p>\r\n",
