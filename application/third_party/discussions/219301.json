I am trying to parse an Excel 2003 file, and I am having problems to retrieve cells with &quot;Date&quot; format. Instead of returning a date like &quot;26/04/2006&quot;, it is returning &quot;38833&quot;.\r\n\r\nHow can I do to make PHPExcel return me the date in a correct way ?\r\n\r\nThanks !",

PHP holds dates as a signed&nbsp;integer value, the number of seconds since/before January 1 1970 00:00:00 GMT, or as a SateTime object. When storing a value to be used as a date using PHPExcel, you need to store the numeric value that Excel will recognise: when reading a date from Excel, you need to convert it to a PHP date/timestamp or DateTime object.
