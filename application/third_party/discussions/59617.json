The data in the sheets work flawlessly, it's just the properties that don't.</p>\r\n<p>I'm also trying to unprotect certain cells in the sheet and leaving the majority of the cells protected - when I try to unprotect a range of cells, say, from B2 to N2500, the script runs out of memory. The only feasible range I can unprotect is about 300 cells. I will try the latest code and report back, but I'd like to know a better alternative to what I'm trying to do.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Thanks koyama, voted for it - hope it's implemented soon, but it's no deal breaker :)</p>\r\n<p>Regarding the protection, I did actually try the method that you have suggested earlier as well - still the same. I tried the latest version from the SVN (I was actually using 1.6.6) and that improved things a lot, I'm able to generate the file now - it takes 20 seconds to do it though - a pity considering I only unprotect the 2500 odd cells and don't put any data in it (it's a requirement to unprotect it, users need to enter data in those rows).</p>\r\n<p>In fact, to avoid this issue, I created a template with 2500 rows unprotected and tried opening the file - still the same amount of time is being taken, so no luck there. As a last resort, I wrote a macro that will unprotect those 2500 rows and made phpexcel grab the template, add the rows from the DB and output it - only to find that the macro wasn't there anymore! I'm really out of options - any help would be great!</p>",
