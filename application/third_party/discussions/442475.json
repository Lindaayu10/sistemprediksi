The chart needs to store the result of the calculation, which means the calculation engine needs to do the calculation.<br />\n<br />\nIt does raise a question: what formulae are you using that are required by your charts that cause the PHPExcel calculation engine to throw a fatal error? Perhaps that should be the question... setting PreCalculateFormulas to FALSE isn't a solution, it's a workround.<br />\n",
