I've read some tips from Mark Baker to limit memory footprint on stackoverflow, and I managed to halve it.</p>\r\n<p>Yet there's something that puzzles me: if I set a Read Filter that always returns false, memory occupation still goes up 9MB upon instantiating the (empty) PHPExcel object.</p>\r\n<p>I was wondering if this is normal, or if I am missing something. Here's my code:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>\t<span style=\"color:blue\">class</span> MyReadFilter <span style=\"color:blue\">implements</span> PHPExcel_Reader_IReadFilter {\r\n\t\t<span style=\"color:blue\">public</span> <span style=\"color:blue\">function</span> readCell($column, $row, $worksheetName = <span style=\"color:#a31515\">''</span>) {\r\n\t\t\t<span style=\"color:blue\">return</span> false;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t$filterSubset = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> MyReadFilter();\r\n\t\r\n\t$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'Excel2007'</span>);\r\n\t$objReader-&gt;setLoadSheetsOnly(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'Export'</span>);\r\n\t$objReader-&gt;setReadDataOnly(true);\r\n\t$objReader-&gt;setReadFilter($filterSubset);\r\n\t\r\n\t$objPHPExcel = $objReader-&gt;load($name);\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Is there anything I can do to reduce those 9MB? I just need to read excel files, never to write them. What about cutting &quot;write&quot; methods away from some classes? Any other ideas?</p>\r\n<p>Thank you</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>Certain features are always loaded, irrespective of read filters. For example, every defined style will always be loaded unless you have setReadDataOnly(true), whether they are actually used in the cells that you filter out or those that you retain. That's because styles are loaded first, without anything to tell us what cells they apply to: it's only when we load the cells themselves (based on the filter) that we can actually assign those styles to their cells... so even an empty workbook can still contain a lot of information.</p>\r\n<p>Likewise, named ranges, printer settings, etc are always loaded, irrespective of the setReadDataOnly() setting, or of read filters.</p>\r\n<p>Only classes that you actually use are loaded (that's the value of the autoloader) so if you don't ever write, none of the writer classes will ever be loaded.</p>",
