This worked well.<br />\n<br />\nI upgraded to PHPExcel 1.8.0: I am able to create the 8 documents but unable to load them into the large excel document.<br />\n<br />\nThe error in Excel2007.php is at line 364:<br />\n$wbRels = simplexml_load_string($this-&gt;_getFromZipArchive($zip, &quot;xl/_rels/workbook.xml.rels&quot;), 'SimpleXMLElement', PHPExcel_Settings::getLibXmlLoaderOptions());<br />\n<br />\n$wbRels is null. So this line: foreach ($wbRels-&gt;Relationship as $rel) { ... does not load anything.<br />\n<br />\nAfter running my code a random number of times, PHPExcel creates the directories _rels, docProps, &amp; xl in the root folder with various files in them. If I remove these folders I am able to load the external sheets into 1 large excel document. When these files/folders exist, I get the error above.<br />\n<br />\nOS: Ubuntu 12.04<br />\n",
