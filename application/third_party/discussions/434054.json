It seems that on the include statement the function fails to find the PHPExcel_Writer_IWriter interface but I am sure all the files needed is in one location and that is on the reports folder. I tried to replace my localhost files with the files from the test server (which is perfectly working) but still i got the same error. \r<br />\n<br />\nCan anyone point what goes wrong ? I've been stuck for 2 days now and still cannot figure the problem.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance <br />\n",
