I investigated the matter and found what is obviously Java code in the middle of the JAMA directories. After a little research my guess is the files in question are an adaptation of the original JAMA Java package, and quite possibly a work in progress. As I may never include said files (my downloading the latest files was just to correct a value type issue I had with Excel5), can I assume it is safe to comment this code out ?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",
