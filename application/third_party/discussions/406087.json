After Excel 2003 &quot;repairing&quot; all data is lost. I use utf-8 encoded text and haven't problem with&nbsp;cyrillic in other cases, also no errors\r\n or exceptions while file creating. I find that the problem in&nbsp;PHPExcel_Shared_String::UTF8toBIFF8UnicodeShort. If use&nbsp;PHPExcel_Shared_String::UTF8toBIFF8UnicodeLong instead of it, file working, but text formating is lost.</p>\r\n<p>Here is an example of broken Excel file: <a href=\"https://rapidshare.com/files/175635924/loads_test.xls\">\r\nhttps://rapidshare.com/files/175635924/loads_test.xls</a></p>\r\n",

    "Html": "\r\n<p>Thanks for reply.</p>\r\n<p>I think I found the solution:</p>\r\n<p>1. In method&nbsp;<span><strong>PHPExcel_Shared_String::UTF8toBIFF8UnicodeShort</strong> we need to set also 0-bit, not only 3-bit (0x09) and to add UTF-8 to UTF-16 conversion:</span></p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre style=\"color:black\">$data = pack(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'vC'</span>, $ln, 0x09); <span style=\"color:green\">// Line #447</span>\n...\n$data .= self::ConvertEncoding($value, <span style=\"color:#a31515\">'UTF-16LE'</span>, <span style=\"color:#a31515\">'UTF-8'</span>); <span style=\"color:green\">// Line #450</span>\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>2. While calculation of first formatted character in method&nbsp;<strong>PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5_Worksheet::close</strong>&nbsp;we need to consider the encoding:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>$str_len = PHPExcel_Shared_String::CountCharacters($cVal-&gt;getPlainText(), <span style=\"color:#a31515\">'UTF-8'</span>); <span style=\"color:green\">// Line #427</span>\n...\n$str_pos &#43;= PHPExcel_Shared_String::CountCharacters($element-&gt;getText(), <span style=\"color:#a31515\">'UTF-8'</span>); <span style=\"color:green\">// Line #440</span>\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<p>Need to test, but it works on my file.</p>\r\n<p>Also I found few little mistakes:</p>\r\n<p>1. Is Named Ranges supported in source of List type in&nbsp;Data validation by&nbsp;Excel5_Writer? When I try to set it, I get the empty source in file.</p>\r\n<p>2. When I want to set width of column, I get width less than I want on 0.71:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>$objSheet-&gt;getColumnDimension(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'A'</span>)-&gt;setWidth( 10 ); <span style=\"color:green\">// it will be 9.29</span>\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>3. Method&nbsp;<strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-size:9pt\">PHPExcel_Calculation::getInstance()-&gt;translateFormulaToEnglish\r\n</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-size:9pt\">returns wrong name when the&nbsp;<span>local name of function</span>&nbsp;is a part of other local name. For example, conversion of &quot;ЕСЛИ&quot; to &quot;IF&quot; has &quot;ЕСЛAND&quot; as result.</span></p>\r\n<p>4. Also it's logical to&nbsp;inherit the cell font&nbsp;formatting by Rich-Text object.</p>\r\n<p>And thanks a lot for your great project!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",
