The offending line is</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<pre>if ($rowDatum != '' &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;_readFilter-&gt;readCell($columnLetter, $currentRow))</pre>\r\nIf somebody really wants to completely <strong>skip</strong> empty cells, which I think is unlikely, he could implement his own filter to do so. The comparison with the empty string makes it impossible to read such files, however.\r\n<p></p>\r\n",
