I do have experience with very large worksheets (&gt; 100K rows) containing exotic characters like strange asian characters, using UTF-8, and that works like a charm. Same goes for styling, works very well. Only problem with big worksheets in terms of data, of many styles is that your script may take long and/or use a lot of memory.</p>",
