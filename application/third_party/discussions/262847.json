But please note that I have worked through all other post and still have no solution to my problem:</p>\n<p>In my database I have values stored like 4.1 (basically an expression for a software version) as a varchar. When I now output it to excel i get 4,1 - with a comma. I tried everything from setting the format code to text (@) or even various conversion attempts  like settype or quoting the variabe.</p>\n<p>I also tried:</p>\n<p>incomingloader=\"4.1\";</p>\n<p>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValueExplicitByColumnAndRow(23, $row, $incomingloader, PHPExcel_Cell_DataType::TYPE_STRING);</p>\n<p>In this case the cell is empty!</p>\n<p>The explicit set of the locale variable also has no effect.</p>\n<p>When I enter the value 4.1 manually in Excel it works fine.&nbsp; I am really despaired. Has anybody a hint for me?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n<p>Michael</p>",
