I don't know how to check uploaded file version, so I don't know what reader's version to read this file. Is there any function\r\n to check excel file version?</p>\r\n<p>I tested with one excel file, error took place 'Cannot read encrypted file.' I tried reader from excel5, excel2003xml to excel2007 with no success. I had to convert this file to excel 5 format. I could read this file with 'excel5' reader.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you.</p>\r\n",
