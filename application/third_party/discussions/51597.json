At the time we were building it on our DEV server everything worked fine (well, actually, sometimes we were getting &quot;unreadable content&quot; errors, but that was very rare cases). Now we moved to our real server and here started the headaches.. Almost everytime MS Office fails to open a PHPExcel saved file (it saves the same file successfully something like 1 out of 10 times). </div><div><br></div><div>I'm just a programmer, not much of a tech guy, so could you possibly tell me what can be causing this? If it helps, I generated good and bad saved files using the code from examples. You can find them here - http://webideja.lt/phpexcel/</div><div><br></div><div>Some info about our server:</div><div>PHP Version 5.2.4-2ubuntu5.5</div><div>Apache 2.0</div><div><div>Zip version<span style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>2.0.0</div><div>Libzip version<span style=\"white-space:pre\">\t</span>0.7.1</div><div><br></div><div>Let me know if you need anything else.

This is strange as it really looked like this was the cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo help finding the bug, can I ask you to try the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the file called <code>'Classes/PHPExcel/Writer/Excel5/Workbook.php'</code>, there is a function called <code>_storeBoundsheet</code>. Insert the following line to check the value of the <code>$offset</code> variable:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<code>\r\nfunction _storeBoundsheet($sheetname,$offset)<br>\r\n{<br>\r\nvar_dump($offset);&nbsp; // insert this line here at the beginning<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n}<br>\r\n</code>\r\n<br>\r\nTry on both servers and post back the results you see on the screen when you run the script.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",

On your DEV server you may get 1, and rarely 2. Can you verify this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have not looked carefully at this, but others have reported weirdness about mbstring function overloading randomly turning on.
