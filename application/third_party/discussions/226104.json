We have moved the code from xamp to IIS server. Everything in the project was working, but the excel report is not woring. It it throwing 500 server error. The same code was working earlier properly.</p>\r\n<p>Internet research is discussing about some error in the code which is causing this fatel error. Any suggestion on how to see the actual PHP error in the log is appreciated. As of now it is just showing the error message as 500 error and some suggestion on IIS settings. I have checked the IIS setting with the admin and everything is good. MS office 2007 is also installed in the IIS server.</p>\r\n<p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>Regards<br>Madhonna</p>\r\n</div>",

In IIS server, right click your root server folder and then select Security tab. Then you can give write permission to the folder. By default it will give permission to all the sub folders </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black;font-size:10pt\">For any future users:<br>I</span><span style=\"color:black;font-size:10pt\">f you are getting similar error especially on any new file generation either fopen or complicated excel report, try to do a simple fopen code to make sure that you have proper permission. </span></p>\r\n<p>Thank you <a id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MasterContent_Content_PostRepeater_ctl02_UserNameLink\" href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/trothman\">trothman</a>&nbsp;for your suggestion.</p>",
