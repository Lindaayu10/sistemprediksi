When I got the fix for the last issue I did a quick test on the production server, got no error messages but didn't look at the output. Now I have finished development, adding graphs by using the jpGraph library and then inserting the resultant images (.png) as worksheet_drawings. It all works beautifully on my Windows development box. Now onto the production server (Linux) for some heavy duty testing. No errors, but the only thing in the outputted .xls file is the graphs, no data. The each indivual worksheet is there, named correctly and with it's relevent graphs but no data.<br>\r\n",

I have tried on both Linux and Windows and both show the same behaviour. <code>tmpname()</code> stops working when <code>open_basedir</code> is outside the temporary directory, but <code>tempfile()</code> continues to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you can send us a link to your phpinfo and something will be revealed?\r\n",
