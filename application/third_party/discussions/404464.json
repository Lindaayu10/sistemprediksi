What I am wondering is their some sort of interface that loads where it looks like Excel? Or is the main purpose of PHPExcel to create .xlsx files so that these can be loaded into Excel?</p>\r\n<p>What I want to do is dynamically create xlsx files using PHPExcel and then open these using ZOHO spreadsheet. I figured I need ZOHO spreadsheet because PHPExcel cannot create the interface as nicely as ZOHO or MS Excel itself?</p>\r\n<p>Please let me know.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Jim</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

I have written a javascript GUI tool\r\n as an experiment, using Ajax to interact with server-side PHPExcel, just to prove it could be done; but it was highly inefficient (even on localhost) and certainly not usable over an internet connection (though it could probably done using websockets or similar,\r\n or a GTK application).</p>\r\n<p>I'm not familiar with ZOHO spreadsheet, but if it can read Excel spreadsheets then it should be able to read the spreadsheet files that are written by PHPExcel.</p>\r\n",
