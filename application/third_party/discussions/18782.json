It is giving an error when I try to open the xlsx file (\"Excel found unreadable content in ...\"). In the end, it removes the header but I can still see the worksheet. The header is missing though. It works fine if there's less data sent in the header.<br /><br />Is there a way around this? It's quite essential that I can send that amount of data in the header.<br /><br />Regards,<br />N9ne<br />",
