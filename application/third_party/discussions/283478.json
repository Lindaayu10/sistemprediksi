No big thing, just creating an xls with about 30 cols and 50 rows.<br /> Did it, tested it, worked like a charm, uploaded it from \"testing\" to \"live\".</p>\n<p>Now, the fun part starts.</p>\n<p>With my test environment (Windows 7, XAMPP) everything runs nice.</p>\n<p>At the live system, the script simply dies silently (even with 'error_reporting(E_ALL);'). No file was written, so i first thought, it's some problem with the access-rights.</p>\n<p>A few (ok, roughly 8 hours) later, i found, that setting cell backcolor is the bad thing. Without backcolor (and it's for about 20 cells only) the script is running and produces a nice and shiny xls.</p>\n<p>Even trying different approaches ( setRGB, setARGB, using palette) won't help.</p>\n<p>So, i'm looking very puzzled at the moment. Having no clue, what's going wrong there. My last code approach was like this:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\n<pre>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getStyle($ColRow)-&gt;getFill()-&gt;setFillType(PHPExcel_Style_Fill::FILL_SOLID);\n$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getStyle($ColRow)-&gt;getFill()-&gt;getStartColor()-&gt;setRGB($BColor);\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Where $BColor ist something valid (even tried fixed \"0000FF\" for blue and \"FF0000FF\" for the setARGB approach.</p>\n<p>I just don't get it, why it works perfectly local and crashes (without notice) at the live system.</p>\n<p>Has anyone fighted with this kind of problem before?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<p>Marc</p>",
