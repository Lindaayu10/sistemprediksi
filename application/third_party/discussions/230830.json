The source documentation does not say so or maybe it is not called &quot;lazy&quot; or similar...</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks and kind regards</p>\r\n<p>rabby</p>",

    "Html": "<p>The &quot;Lazy Loader&quot; is the class loader, that only loads the PHPExcel code that is actaully required by your script at the point when it is actually needed. This is not configurable in any way, it simply happens, and is controlled through the PHPExcel_Autoloader class in Autoloader.php.</p>\r\n<p>There is no smart loader for cells: the closest you'll find is the &quot;cell caching&quot; mechanism, which allows the cell objects maintained by PHPExcel to be held outside of PHP's memory, reducing the overall memory footprint required for holding workbook data. This can be configured through PHPExcel_Settings::setCacheStorageMethod() which uses the PHPExcel_CachedObjectStorageFactory class. This is detailed in section 4.2.1 of the developer documentation.</p>",

E.g. I do not want to change or read the rows 1-10000, but start from 10001 for pushing content into a  xlsx sheet. I did not find an alternative o the typical .load() function.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks again</p>",
