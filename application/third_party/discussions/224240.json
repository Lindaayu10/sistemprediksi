I have verified that this occurs both when:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>creating the original file using Excel 2010 and using it for PHPExcel's load()</li>\r\n<li>creating the original using PHPExcel and then editing the file using Excel 2010 to add my template items and then using it for PHPExcel's load()</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Lastly I have verified that this doesn't occur at all when just using PHPExcel to generate a file and viewing it in Excel 2010 - with the sheet built 100% programatically. I assume there is some difference in colour management between Excel 2007 and 2010 that is causing this and the PHPExcel library is spitting out proper 2007 files while any changes in 2010 result in an 'upgrade' of the xlsx format with different 2010 code.</p>\r\n<p>I realise Excel 2010 might not yet be officially supported, but is this a known-issue?</p>\r\n<p>Many thanks,<br>-Will</p>",

About to start again though, so I'll let you know.</p>\r\n<p>I was kind of hoping that reverting to creating templates in Excel 2007 would solve the issue!</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps explicitly setting a white background on creation might help?
