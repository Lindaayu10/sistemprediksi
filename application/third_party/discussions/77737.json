The second parameter is used to indicate what that custom symbol is. By default it is <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">null</span>, but you may be using something else.</p>\r\n<p>Try to use this:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;fromArray($apps, null, <span style=\"color:#a31515\">'G6'</span>);<br></pre>\r\n</div>",

Here comes the solutions:</p>\r\n<p>The method fromArray() expects an array where as each element represents a row. Therefore to make things work you got to have to make each element an array, too.</p>\r\n<p>Example:</p>\r\n<p>$source =&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Consolas, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;white-space:pre\">Array </span><span style=\"font-family:Consolas, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;white-space:pre\">(</span></p>\r\n<pre>    [0] =&gt; Array\r\n        (\r\n            [0] =&gt; CellA1\r\n            [1] =&gt; CellB1\r\n            [2] =&gt; CellC1\r\n        )\r\n<pre>    [1] =&gt; Array\r\n        (\r\n            [0] =&gt; CellA2\r\n            [1] =&gt; CellB2\r\n            [2] =&gt; CellC2\r\n        )</pre>\r\n)</pre>",
