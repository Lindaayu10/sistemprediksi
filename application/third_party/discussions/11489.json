I initially was using some very simple php code to generate my Excel file's from my database... <br /><br />&lt;?php<br /><br />$query = \"SELECT * FROM `table`\";<br />$result = mysql_query($query) or die('Error, query failed');<br /><br />$tsv  = array();<br />$html = array();<br />while($row = mysql<i>fetch</i>array($result, MYSQL_NUM))<br />{<br />   $tsv[]  = implode(\"\\t\", $row);<br />   $html[] = \"&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\" .implode(\"&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;\", $row) .              \"&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\";<br />}<br /><br />$tsv = implode(\"\\r\\n\", $tsv);<br />$html = \"&lt;table&gt;\" . implode(\"\\r\\n\", $html) . \"&lt;/table&gt;\";<br /><br />$fileName = 'mysql-to-excel.xls';<br />header(\"Content-type: application/vnd.ms-excel\"); <br />header(\"Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=$fileName\");<br /><br />echo $tsv;<br />//echo $html;<br /><br />?&gt;<br /><br />It donwloads the info I need to but is very messy and doesn't have the table column names, people have pointed me in this direction, I have had a look at the source code. The things that can be done look great! But as I'm new to php was hoping someone could tell me which class or file I should use? I don't want to do anything overlly complicated just download the table, and have the column names as headings... I guess if I could pick exactly which columns where downloaded from the table that would be great too, but anything to get me started!<br /><br />Thanks all in advance I hope I've posted in the correct area!<br />",
