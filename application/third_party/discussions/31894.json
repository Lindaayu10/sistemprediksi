This all works fine when using Excel2007, but when I try using Excel5 instead even though there is no error, it simply refuses to put the image on the excel document.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately because the people who will use this don't have the latest version of Excel, I have to use the Excel5 class...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've stripped out all the other code, and this is the part of my code that doesn't seem to work:</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p dir=ltr style=\"margin-right:0px\"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;set_include_path('../includes/Classes/');</em></p>\r\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;/** PHPExcel */<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;include 'PHPExcel.php';</em></p>\r\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;/** PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 */<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;include 'PHPExcel/Writer/Excel5.php';</em></p>\r\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;// Create new PHPExcel object<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;$objPHPExcel = new PHPExcel();</em></p>\r\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;// Send the headers to allow this document to be sent to the browser rather than saving it to disk<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;header(&quot;Pragma: public&quot;);<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;header(&quot;Expires: 0&quot;);<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;header(&quot;Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0&quot;); <br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;header(&quot;Content-Type: application/force-download&quot;);<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;header(&quot;Content-Type: application/octet-stream&quot;);<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;header(&quot;Content-Type: application/download&quot;);;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;header(&quot;Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=test.xls&quot;);<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;header(&quot;Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary &quot;);</em></p>\r\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;$objDrawing = new PHPExcel_Worksheet_Drawing();<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;$objDrawing-&gt;setPath('./images/logo.bmp');<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;$objDrawing-&gt;setCoordinates('B5');<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;$objDrawing-&gt;setWorksheet($objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet());</em></p>\r\n<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;// Set active sheet index to the first sheet, so Excel opens this as the first sheet<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;$objPHPExcel-&gt;setActiveSheetIndex(0);<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;// Save Excel 2005 file<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;$objWriter = new PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5($objPHPExcel);<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;// Send the document to the browser<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;$objWriter-&gt;save(&quot;php://output&quot;);<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</em></p>\r\n<em>\r\n<hr>\r\n<br>\r\n</em>If I change the class&nbsp;I'm using to the Excel2007 one everything works fine. Originally I had used a jpeg but this was bringing up an error - I take it Excel5 doesn't support image types other than bipmaps so I converted the image to that. But it still doesn't work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe excel document opens fine, and when I have other code in there the data is printed fine, it seems to just be the image part that isn't working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan someone please help me and let me know if it is something I am doing wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks.\r\n",
