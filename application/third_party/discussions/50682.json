This is not mentioned in the developer documentation because it will not work as expected if you load a workbook and try to modify the styles. But those who are familiar with PEAR Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer will find this technique familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing shared styles, you may not see any significant increase in speed using PHPExcel 1.6.6.
