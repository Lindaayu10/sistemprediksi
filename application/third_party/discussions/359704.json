    "Html": "\r\n<p>I thought I'd explained why I'd&nbsp;rejected that patch when I declined it: you should have received an email from codeplex explaining that. It's because I'm starting to rewrite the calculation engine as a multiton rather than a singleton, which means that\r\n it won't clash once that is completed, but that work will also refactor the calculation engine to improve its performance and reduce some of&nbsp;its complexities in accessing the parent workbook.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<pre>The patch has been declined for the project PHPExcel on CodePlex.com.\r\n\r\nDescription: \r\n\r\nI'm not going to apply this patch because I'm intending a major rewrite\r\nof the calculation engine over the next quarter and among other changes\r\nit will be switched from a singleton to a multiton pattern, effectively\r\ncreating a calculation object for every workbook, so each will have its \r\nown calculation cache and no risk of clashes. Can't remember what Work \r\nItem this is, but it's somewhere in the issues log. Note that it'll also \r\nsupport a standalone instance for those cases where people want to use \r\nthe calculation engine without instantiating/loading a workbook.\r\n\r\nBut thanks for offering the patch, and don't stop submitting more. The \r\nothers that you've uploaded have been appreciated (especially given the \r\nsubtle differences between Open and Libre office).\r\n\r\nNote also that we're moving the source code repository to github over \r\nthe next week, so it should be a lot easier to submit any changes... \r\nthough we'll be replicating changes between github and codeplex SVN for \r\na while.\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\n\r\n- The CodePlex team</pre>\r\n<p>There's nothing to prevent you or anybody else including the patch code that you submitted in your own copy of PHPExcel, but to be aware that the code is being rewritten</p>\r\n<p>I've left the issue that you raised as a placeholder to remind me, and because it includes the patch as a file attachment.</p>\r\n",
