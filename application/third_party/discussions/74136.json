The code is below.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // read template xls file &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;$reader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel5');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;$excel = $reader-&gt;load(EXCEL_FILE_PATH.&quot;template.xls&quot;);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;// set active sheet<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;$excel-&gt;setActiveSheetIndex(0);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;$sheet = $excel-&gt;getActiveSheet();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // output excel file<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;$writer = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($excel, 'Excel5');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;$writer-&gt;save(EXCEL_FILE_PATH.&quot;output.xls&quot;);</p>\r\n<p>And there are a graph object in the template excel. This template excel has two sheets and one is main and another is the base data for the graph in the main sheet.</p>\r\n<p>I expected that a copied file of template.xls which the name is output.xls would be created. It's actually created, however only a graph object wasn't copied. Other than that, everything has been copied such as Font, Letter, Color, Border and even image.</p>\r\n<p>All I want to do is copy a template file to output file and change some letters and base data for the graph in the output file.</p>\r\n<p>Did I miss something? Any advice would be appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
