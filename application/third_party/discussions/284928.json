When I separate them, they works, but in the one file $objDrawing could not see the picture pointed in the path and shows an error. I don't know what I am doing wrong. Could someone help me? Is there any different way to export directly a chart from pChart to the PHPExcel's spreadsheet?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks &amp; Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Janek</p>",
