Cells without borders are getting an extremely thick (about 20px) black border that obscures some of the cell content,\r\n and merged cells with borders are only displaying a partial border in the top-right cell. It's something that I want to get right, because it will make a lot of users happy, but my focus for much of the last month has been on the performance of the Writers,\r\n particularly for Excel5 and Excel2007, and I think the 25%-30% improvement in speed (and the reduction in memory usage for the Excel5 Writer) will make people even happier with the next release. I know that the HTML and PDF Writers are also slow, and will\r\n be focusing my attentions on them over the next week to see if I can get similar speed improvements there. I'll take a look at the PDF borders while I'm doing that, and see if I can get better results with the newest tcPDF.</p>\r\n",

I know some people have just overwritten the version of tcPDF provided in the PHPExcel distribution with the latest source from tcpdf.org, and it has worked for them.\r\n It doesn't work on any of my test boxes, so clearly some work is needed to ensure that it will work correctly for everybody; but a simple replacement may work for you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
