    "Html": "<p>The only situation I can think of where there could be a change from PHPExcel 1.7.0 to 1.7.1 is in a situation like this.<br> <br> Consider this line:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>$worksheet-&gt;getCell(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'A1'</span>)-&gt;setValueExplicit(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">''</span>, PHPExcel_Cell_DataType::TYPE_NUMERIC);<br></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>In PHPExcel 1.7.0 you will probably see a blank cell when you open the generated Excel file, but in 1.7.1 you will see a 0.<br> <br> What is happening here? When you use <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">PHPExcel_Cell_DataType::TYPE_NUMERIC</span>, the first argument is really expected to be a number. But <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">''</span> is not a number, it is an empty string.<br> <br> In PHPExcel 1.7.0 such code <strong>could</strong> result in corrupt Excel files (xlsx). Try this with PHPExcel 1.7.0 and you will see that you get a corrupt xlsx file:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>$worksheet-&gt;getCell(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'A1'</span>)-&gt;setValueExplicit(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'abc'</span>, PHPExcel_Cell_DataType::TYPE_NUMERIC);<br></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>In PHPExcel 1.7.1 a mechanism was added to protect against such errors<br> <a href=\"../WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=10600\">http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=10600</a><br> <br> That could explain why you get different results, but the above should explain why the approach of PHPExcel 1.7.1 is the correct.<br> <br> To summarize, you should only use <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">PHPExcel_Cell_DataType::TYPE_NUMERIC</span> when you really want a number. A number cannot be blank. If you for some reason want a blank cell, use an empty string:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>$worksheet-&gt;getCell(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'A1'</span>)-&gt;setValueExplicit(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">''</span>, PHPExcel_Cell_DataType::TYPE_STRING);<br></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><em>Note: Do not confuse data types and number formats. The above has to do with data types and not number formats.</em></p>",
