    "Html": "You're right. AutoSize isn't very accurate in PHPExcel. But it will be very difficult to get it 100% accurate in PHPExcel. We would need to implement a full Excel rendering engine that can measure preferred column width on the basis of individual glyph widths, font family, and font size. I think this feature is not coming in the near future. However, we should try to improve setAutoSize(). We can probably do it a bit better than now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, I must suggest that you set column widths to fixed sizes. Make them e.g. a bit wider than expected maximum width. That is the best I can suggest right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
