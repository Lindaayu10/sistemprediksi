Why not just rely on the require_once method to fail if the library does not exist?\r<br />\n<br />\nThe file_exists and is_readable functions do not use the include_path which means that even though a PDF library exists PHPExcel will refuse to use it unless you use explicit paths.  I like to ensure my code is portable and therefore use relative paths however these checks prevent me doing this.\r<br />\n<br />\nI think you should consider removing these redundant checks.\r<br />\n<br />\n-Mark<br />\n",
