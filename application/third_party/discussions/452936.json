    "Html": "Sorry, that's not really a technical term. I meant having a .xls file that was created that didn't have the formula in it. Anyway, I've figured out what the problem was.\r<br />\n<br />\nSome of my cells were percentage values, however phpexcel didn't understand the cell format and was entering them as a string. To resolve this issue I change the following:\r<br />\n<br />\nFrom:<br />\n<pre><code>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValue('F21', $options['tax_1'].'%'));</code></pre>\n\nTo:<br />\n<pre><code>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValue('F21', ($options['tax_1'] / 100));\n$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getStyle('F21')-&gt;getNumberFormat()-&gt;setFormatCode('0.00%');</code></pre>\n\nRegards<br />\n",
