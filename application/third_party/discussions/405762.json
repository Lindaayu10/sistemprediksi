I tried restarting apache even my workstation to purge cached\r\n data but to no avail, I simply don't know what could be the problem.

The problem I'm facing is that whenever I open a new file using this code the data/cell/colum\r\n of this file will be overwritten with the data of my previous opened file (last subject file). It's like there's a cloning happening when the $object-&gt;load() is executed. Could this be a cache? Thanks for your speedy reply very much appreciated.</p>\r\n",
