The values are being used to construct an HTML table, or an excel file, depending on what the user clicks, basically.</p>\r\n<p>I'm thinking for the images, find some way to go through and replace the image tags, and use the new PHPExcel_Worksheet_Drawing() for the images, but not sure how I should deal with other HTML. Just strip it out? or convert it somehow?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>",
