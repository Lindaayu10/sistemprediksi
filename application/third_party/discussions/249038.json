The problem I have is that something is happening that is causing the images to all scale in one axis, thus leaving the image visually distorted.&nbsp;\r\n I have tried everything I can think of to counter this, and nothing is working.&nbsp; If I leave out the images, I can open the spreadsheet in OpenOffice or Excel, and add the images fine (either as floating objects or cell content).\\</p>\r\n<p>Has anyone expereicend this and come up with a solution?&nbsp; Any ideas what is going on?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>\r\n",
