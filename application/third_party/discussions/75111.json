What you are talking about is probably <strong>file protection</strong> where users can't even open the Excel file without the password. This is different from <strong>workbook protection</strong>. Workbook protection is to prevent the user from things such as creating/moving sheets etc, but it does not prevent them from opening the Excel file itself. This is again different from <strong>worksheet protection</strong> which is to prevent the user from editing cells, formatting columns etc. in a certain sheet.</p>\r\n<p>Last time we looked at file protection, the conclusion was that there was not sufficient information about the algorithms to read/write such files.</p>",
