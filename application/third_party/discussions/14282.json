Eventually I drilled down to Excell2007/Worksheet.php#_writeCell which if the cell is a formular as of 1.4.5 now checks if getPreCalculateFormulas() comes back true (which it always will by default as no setting is otherwise performed) and then stored the precalculated value as the value of the cell (which is always 0).<br /><br />Removing this to the functionality of 1.4.0 resolves the problem although it does cause a a \"save changes?\" dialog when you close the file in excel. But at least my =SUM() works again.<br />",

To have 1.4.5 produce the same I had to apply 2 changes:<br /><br /><ul><li>in <i>Writer/Excel2007/Worksheet.php</i> comment out line <b>784</b> --&gt; $objWriter-&gt;writeElement('v', '0'); This ensures that when using <i>setPreCalculateFormulas(false);</i> the same behaviour as 1.4.0 is preserved i.e. don't add a &lt;v&gt;0&lt;/v&gt; tag. </li></ul><br /><ul><li>in <i>Writer/Excel2007/Workbook.php</i> comment out line <b>87</b> --&gt; $this-&gt;_writeBookViews($objWriter, $pPHPExcel); Again this is required to reproduce the 1.4.0 bahaviour. Somehow adding the &lt;workbookView&gt; tag to workbook.xml is breaking the formula re-calculation on opening, It also has the effect of selecting all of the sheet tabs on opening and positioning on the last sheet. This is removed when commenting out the line.</li></ul><br />Here is a sample code that generates a document that can reproduce the above:<br /><br />set_include_path(get_include_path() .

But, if you apply the changes you just did, formula re-calculation in Excel2007 is broken... Pity these two don't behave the same way!<br /><br />Would it be useful to add a \"behaviour\" switch in PHPExcel? I.e. you can create OpenXML for Excel2007 and for Excel2003 compatibility pack by setting a boolean switch?<br />",
