Maybe PHPExcel can calculate my formula ?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for help.<br />\n",

That is, it should contain a English language names for functions, and use a comma separator for function arguments.\r<br />\n<br />\nYou only need to use locale settings if you are setting/changing a formula and wish to use French language names for functions and a ; argument separator, that's what I thought you were trying to do.\r<br />\n<br />\nLooking at your formula though, it looks as though it should be an array formula, which isn't supported yet by PHPExcel<br />\n",
