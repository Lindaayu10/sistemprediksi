    "Html": "I am new to PHPExcel and have made great progress except for one thing.  I am still trying to understand how to turn an Excel Conditional Format into a PHPExcel Conditional format.  My desire is to set up alternate rows of background color for a table on a worksheet.  In Excel I use the formula &quot;=MOD(ROW(),2)=0&quot; along with a background color format to color every other row.  This will also work when the rows are sorted.\r<br />\n<br />\nHow can I set this up as a conditional then apply it to the rows on my worksheet?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance,\r<br />\n<br />\nChuck<br />\n",
