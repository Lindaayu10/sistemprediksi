Even just modifying the &quot;00simple.php&quot; example from the Tests directory to print some danish characters does not work. Once it meets the first danish character it stops printing further to the current cell. Does anyone know if there's a way to work around this? Thanks!</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hi Koyama, thanks a lot for your reply. I figured out that the Eclipse editor on my Mac saved my files using the wrong encoding. However, it is still not working. Unfortunately, my web hosting (at present) does not have the PHP extension php_zip and php_xml enabled. Because of this I've been trying just to generate Excel5 files, and that worked nicely, but without the &aelig;-&oslash;-&aring; letters. Is the php_zip and php_xml extensions necessary for the various special characters? As far as I can understand from the thread you refer to, it is. Is that right?</p>",

However, you will need <em>either</em> <strong>iconv</strong> or <strong>mbstring</strong> enabled to read/write xls files containing non-ASCII characters with Excel5 reader/writer. Most hosts (even the cheap ones) have both of those enabled, so I don't think this is the problem, but check phpinfo() anyway to be sure.</p>",
