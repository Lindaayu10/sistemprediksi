    "Html": "<p>Mark, thanks for your quick response. Something is definitely weird here. I have pretty much commented out everything out of the code generating this file other than this line:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>$coverSheet-&gt;setCellValue('B1', 'My bike is red and blue and white'); &lt;&lt; This will give me a corrupt file that will not open with XL.</p>\r\n<p>when I change the line to the one below it works fine.</p>\r\n<p>$coverSheet-&gt;setCellValue('B1', 'My bike is red and blue and whit'); &lt;&lt; This opens OK</p>\r\n<p>So there is something going on here related to cell size/string length. Seems that 32 characters is the max before I see the problem. &nbsp;Like I said when I point my browser to the server still running PHP 5.2.9 there is no issues.</p>\r\n<p>There are no errors in the file when I look at it with vi text editor. Any other suggestions?</p>",
