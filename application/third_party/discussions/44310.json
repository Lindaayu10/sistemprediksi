Problem is this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<code>\r\nif ('I' &lt; 'AJ') {<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;echo 'I is less than AJ';<br>\r\n} else {<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;echo 'I is not less than AJ';<br>\r\n}<br>\r\n</code>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this above example PHP will say that <code>'I'</code> is greater than <code>'AJ'</code> because it sorts strings like in a dictionary which is not what we want in this case. Go to the link and look at the example how to properly loop through the cells in the sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks for your feedback! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
