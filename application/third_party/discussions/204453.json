I'm only interested in the rows and columns which have actually been allowed by the read filter. With the issue mentioned above it is a bit understandable that this is the result. I do, however, find it unexpected behaviour since you specified what you actually want to use by the read filter. Is there a way to prevent this behaviour?</p>",
