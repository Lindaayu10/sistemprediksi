But it column may be change from file to file. so, I cann't hard code it's position. That is why I created a loop and trying to get width of each column. But method getWidth() from ColumnDimension.php always returns me -1; How can I solve this problem?<br />\n<pre><code>$colWidth = $objectSelectedWorksheet-&gt;getColumnDimension(&quot;$strCol&quot;)-&gt;getWidth();</code></pre>\n\nwhere $objectSelectedWorksheet - is selected worksheet, $strCol - generated string name of column (i.e. A, B, etc).<br />\n",
