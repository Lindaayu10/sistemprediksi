The only things i want to know is:\r<br />\nis it possible to let the image be sortable with the data in the same row? You know like the famous flag options on MS Excel &quot;Move but don't size/Move and size/etc..&quot;.\r<br />\nI've read other discussions, but i didn't find answers about this.\r<br />\n<br />\nthank you!<br />\n",
