The spreadsheets look perfect on all platforms that I've tested except for iOS.  On iOS they are missing a bunch of data.\r<br />\n<br />\nEach sheet contains at least one &quot;table&quot; of information.  Some sheets have only one, some have up to 4.  These tables are just sections of the sheet separated by 3 blank rows.  Each of these tables has their own row of column labels for their data.  If you are looking at a sheet that only contains one of these tables everything looks fine.  If you are looking at a sheet that contains more than one table then the last one looks fine, but the other ones only display the header row and blank rows where the data should be.  This same spreadsheet looks perfect when viewed on an Android device or in Windows.\r<br />\n<br />\nThere is nothing special being done to create one sheet versus another.  It is the same code that is being executed in a while loop.  Therefore, the same code that is creating the top table on one sheet that looks perfectly fine is the same code that is creating the top table on another sheet where the data is missing.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe spreadsheets in question are being sent as an email attachment and being opened on an iPhone 6.<br />\n",
