    "Html": "Hi, I'm using PHP Version 5.3.10 and I'm working with drupal 7.  I was able to follow the instructions from this <a href=\"https://drupal.org/project/phpexcel\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a> (at the Drupal site) to install the PHPExcel module (version 7.x-3.7). I've also installed the Classes, Documentations, Example folders and changelog.txt to my /en/sites/all/libraries/PHPExcel directory  (and also made sure that the versions section was set to a number: * @version    1.7.9, 2013-06-02)<br />\n<br />\nSo why is it, when I access the Examples/01simple.php file I only get the following display?<br />\n<pre><code>19:12:24 Create new PHPExcel object\n19:12:24 Set document properties\n19:12:24 Add some data\n19:12:24 Rename worksheet\n19:12:24 Write to Excel2007 format\n19:12:25 File written to 01simple.xlsx\nCall time to write Workbook was 0.0679 seconds\n19:12:25 Current memory usage: 5.5 MB\n19:12:25 Write to Excel5 format\n19:12:25 File written to 01simple.xls\nCall time to write Workbook was 0.0427 seconds\n19:12:25 Current memory usage: 7.75 MB\n19:12:25 Peak memory usage: 7.75 MB\n19:12:25 Done writing files\nFiles have been created in C:\\dirName\\dirName2\\en\\sites\\all\\libraries\\PHPExcel\\Examples</code></pre>\n\nI've also tried this with the 17html.php example and I see the 17html.html file has appeared in the same Examples directory however when I try to access that, I get a blank page.<br />\n<br />\nAlso when I try to access the /en/sites/all/libraries/PHPExcel/Classes/PHPExcel.php I also get a blank page.  What gives? I tried to follow all directions to the letter, but I am not getting a display. In fact, the only thing that DOES display seeming properly are the pages in the /en/sites/all/libraries/PHPExcel/Documentation/API directory.<br />\n<br />\nI feel that something is missing, I'm not sure which function or set of code lines to put in a page to make the thing work.<br />\n<br />\nDrupal is annoying enough, would like to put this headache to rest so a successful solution would be greatly appreciated.<br />\n",

I was under the impression that the phpexcel script would provide some sort of user interface. However, after installing everything, I have no clue what to do next in order to get the desired result which is an excel sheet on a webpage.<br />\n<br />\nAny suggestions?<br />\n",

    "Html": "PHPExcel is a set of classes to read and write Excel files. Some classes deviate a little from this fundamental to allow to read CSV files (to make Excel files and not for import into a database) or write in a PDF file, an html file, to name a few.\r<br />\nIt's like a Toolbox made available to a mechanic. Without mechanic (programmer) to use it, nothing happens. It comes with an instruction manual (and not a simple slip: the documentation is 10 MB) containing many examples.\r<br />\nPHPExcel is not a tool that produces a result with great blows of drag-and-drop, it is necessary to write the code to put in motion\r<br />\nFile 01-download - xls.php offers a simple Excel file, that it is sufficient to expand, the file 17html.php generates an html file representing an Excel sheet.\r<br />\nImplement does not give the expected result? OK. But it takes information to help solve a problem.<br />\n",
