    "Html": "I am using PHPExcel to generate and store Excel 2007 files as raw (BLOB) data in MySQL database. For this purpose I need the Excel file put inside a PHP string variable before I can save it in the database, but there seems to be no way of doing this without first having to save a temporary file. What I am therefore currently doing is the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Generate PHPExcel object</li>\r\n    <li>Save Excel file in temporary storage using the save() method of PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007</li>\r\n    <li>Use file_get_contents() function to read the saved file and store it into a string variable, say $str</li>\r\n    <li>Save $str in the database</li>\r\n    <li>Delete the temporary file</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one can see, I am really not using the file saved to disk for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore I was looking for some mechanism so I can skip first having to save the Excel file in the file system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n$str = $objWriter-&gt;getString(); // would be nice if this gave you the raw Excel file as a string<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs there a way to achieve this without first having to save file to in file system?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: I looked through the documentation as well as all discussion topics to see if this problem has been addressed before. Sorry if I have overlooked something.\r\n",

    "Html": "Thanks, Maarten, for that link plus quick response. This stuff was new to me so I learned many things from reading that section. While I feel I made some progress, I am still now sure exactly what you had in mind as how to avoid the intermediate file?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst I thought, aha, you are saying that the save method accepts a stream reference so one could do something like this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<code>\r\n$fp = fopen('php://memory', 'r+');<br>\r\n$writer-&gt;save($fp); // not working<br>\r\n$str = stream_get_contents($fp);<br>\r\n</code>\r\n<br>\r\nbut that was not the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I thought perhaps try some crazy thing like this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<code>\r\n$writer-&gt;save('php://memory');<br>\r\n</code>\r\n<br>\r\nbut then how would I grab the stream? Anyway, I got error message (using PHPExcel changeset 13825 from SVN):<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<code>\r\nFatal error: Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'Could not close zip file php://memory.' in /opt/lampp/htdocs/dev/current/www/classes/PHPExcel/Writer/Excel2007.php:383 Stack trace: #0 /opt/lampp/htdocs/dev/current/www/test.php(32): PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007-&gt;save('php://memory') #1 {main} thrown in /opt/lampp/htdocs/dev/current/www/classes/PHPExcel/Writer/Excel2007.php on line 383<br>\r\n</code>\r\n<br>\r\nI would be glad if you could give me a second hint of what you had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it is just me, but I would find it useful if there was a more direct way of getting the raw Excel file using some method in the writer class. As far as I can see, if you can just get the raw contents you will be in a better position to do whatever you want. Saving the Excel file on disk, in database, or redirecting output to a client browser should all be simple tasks if you have direct access to the raw contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks again for your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT: Slightly rephased last paragraph for better clarification.<br>\r\n",
