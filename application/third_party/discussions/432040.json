I use phpexcel to export some data from a database into excel. \r<br />\n<br />\nIt has always worked on my site until recently I changed my live server. Now it works perfectly on my two test servers but it does not work on the live. Something in the server configuration must have changed. What? I checked phpinfo and everything seems to be installed and updated.\r<br />\n<br />\nCould you please tell me exactly what I should check on server side. Are there any permission, php special settings. I really don't know what to check anymore. \r<br />\n<br />\nPlease let me know, it could even be the most stupid thing forgotten.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you very much\r<br />\n<br />\nMush<br />\n",
