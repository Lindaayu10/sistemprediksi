    "Html": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have started to use the PHPExcel to create Excel spreadsheet from a csv file. After that I want to import the file into an application which requires an Excel 2003 file format.\r\nI was easily :) able to create the file in the right format etc.. but my issue is now when I try to import the file in to our application. The Application is complaining about &quot;block[ 0 ] already removed&quot;.\r\n\r\nI searched online and it looks as if this error is caused by the java application which is reading the file when the file is not all required details in it. I found then on the PEARL &quot;Spreadsheet-WriteExcel&quot; documentation that they have a compatibility mode which is supposed to prevent this issue from happening but you have to manually activate it. My understanding is that PHPExcel is using the PEAR Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer library for the Excel5 format and that is based on the PEARL stuff. If all that is correct then my question is now:\r\n\r\nDose anybody know how I can activate the compatibility_mode on the Excel5 writer or how I can make the output compatible with my app?\r\n\r\nI have currently a workaround but that that defends the purpose completely of automation, I can open the created .xls file in Excel and save it again, after that it works fine in my app.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help\r\n\r\nRene",
