Normally it should be: application/vnd.ms-excel for Excel2003 document or application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet for an Excel2007 document. But when i am checking the mime type with PHP to upload a file already created it is not working....<br /><br />Below is my PHP code to check which mime type the file is (it is working fine normally):<br /><br />if(($<i>FILES<a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Wiki/View.aspx?title=%24fileElementName\">$fileElementName</a><a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Wiki/View.aspx?title=%27type%27\">'type'</a>=='application/vnd.ms-excel')||($</i>FILES<a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Wiki/View.aspx?title=%24fileElementName\">$fileElementName</a><a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Wiki/View.aspx?title=%27type%27\">'type'</a>=='application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet')){<br />//action<br />} else {<br />//action2<br />}<br /><br />Does someone has any clue about it?<br /><br />Thanks a lot!<br />Ludo<br />",

I check a bit online, I could not find any information about it. So probably it does that... I do not know..<br />The thing is it recognizes well the Excel2003 files when I send one I just created, it does the action1 (which is what I want), but when I send a Excel file created with PHPExcel so with normally the MIME type of Excel2007, it does not work and it executes the action2.<br />",
