They are just numbers in Excel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you need to look at is the number format.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<code>\r\n$formatCode = $worksheet-&gt;getStyle('A1')-&gt;getNumberFormat()-&gt;getFormatCode();<br>\r\n</code>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, it may give you this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<code>\r\n&quot;[$-F400]h:mm:ss\\ AM/PM&quot;<br>\r\n</code>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you have a date. There is a function which may be useful:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<code>\r\n$bool = PHPExcel_Shared_Date::isDateTimeFormatCode($formatCode); // true if $formatCode is date/time-like<br>\r\n</code>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not sure whether this method is bullet proof for filtering dates and times, but you may give it a try.
