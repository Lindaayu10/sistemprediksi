I know that PHPExcel does not &quot;know&quot; (for lack of a better word) about this function. That is OK since I do not need to read the calculated value from it. I do want to keep it in the spreadsheet, though, so I am proceeding by setting setPreCalculateFormulas to false.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf I do nothing more than below, I get completely empty cells where the COUNTIFS functions should be. Of course, if I do not setPreCalculateFormulas(FALSE), then it complaints about the function and does not save anything out... Can anyone think of a reason why setPreCalculateFormulas(FALSE) would be removing all formulas from the Excel spreadsheet?\r<br />\n<br />\n$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel2007');\r<br />\n$xlsx = $objReader-&gt;load($template);\r<br />\n<br />\n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($xlsx,'Excel2007');\r<br />\n$objWriter-&gt;setPreCalculateFormulas(FALSE);\r<br />\n$objWriter-&gt;save($summary);\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for any help provided.<br />\n",

Maybe the sheet names/hidden rows/etc has something to do with it on top of setPreCalculateFormulas? Possible its elsewhere.\r<br />\n<br />\nI can create my own spreadsheet with &quot;COUNTIFS&quot; formulas and setPreCalculateFormulas does not remove them, but for whatever reason this spreadsheet is giving me problems. I can't save the spreadsheet w/out &quot;setPreCalculateFormulas&quot; because of the COUNIFS formulas, and I can't setPreCalculateFormulas to false because it completely removes the formula altogether.\r<br />\n<br />\nI wish I could provide the spreadsheet to prove my case, but can't since it is from a large (financial industry, lots of regulations) client who would not appreciate it being shared. I can guarantee you formulas are being removed from the spreadsheet, though. I'll post a response here if I ever do figure it out. For now, I think I'll try to come up with an alternate solution to getting data into this sheet...<br />\n",
