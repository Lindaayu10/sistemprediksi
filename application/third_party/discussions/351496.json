I have the same problem trying -5000, -4000, -3000 and -2000.<br /> <br /> When i debug the code, i see that about the 8/9 iteration, the line number 29 begins to return a NAN result, making all of other results to turn NAN too.<br /> <br /> BUT, when i call something like rate(60, -1000, 120000) it returns me a float -0.02044..., exactly the same result of MS Excel.<br /> <br /> I have already tryed to convert all of math calculations into BCMath functions, but this way the results of -6000 is wrong (-1.0427... instead of 0,04678...) but using -1000 the result is correct, matching excel's result.<br /> <br /> Is there a way to make it work correctly? Is it a bug?<br /> <br /> Thanks in advance for any useful sight about that.</p>",
