But styles disappears ! Is it possible to keep styles ?<br>\r\n2) I have found how to add a row but it is a blank one. Is it possible to clone or anything else in order to copy a row and just manage data in there. I do not want to mange styles of each row I add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks in advance for helping a newbie ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvain</p>\r\n",
