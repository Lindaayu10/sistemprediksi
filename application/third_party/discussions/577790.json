I found some errors running scripts related with PHPtoExcel at this new host. I changed nothing from my old scripts because i knew they work like a charm, but not now.<br />\n<br />\nThis is the error i'm getting:<br />\n<br />\nParse error: syntax error, unexpected '[', expecting ')' in /var/www/html/EZ/Classes/PHPExcel/Writer/Excel2007/Chart.php on line 637<br />\n<br />\nI think the issue should be related with php.ini or something like that because it's the only thing that changed...i'm running the script with php 5.3.3<br />\n<br />\nThank you in advance<br />\nEsteban<br />\n",
