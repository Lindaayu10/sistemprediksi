Thanks for this wonderful piece of work!\r<br />\n<br />\nThe HTML writer creates a CSS section in the HEAD of the resulting HTML with some styling definitions. \r<br />\nIs there any plan to make these styling definitions more flexible, instead of hard-coded?\r<br />\nOr would that be something interresting, I could contribute to the project?\r<br />\n<br />\nOf course I could do that in my own version, however this would break compatibility with the original library (causing issues when updating the library in my component).\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards\r<br />\nRuediger Schultz<br />\n",
