Excel's parser isn't particularly clean, and the PHPExcel parser is getting kludgy too just to handle the variations. Ranges and intersections are particularly awkward (a space is the intersection operator, just to confuse parsers). A1:C3 is the most common form for ranges, or the use of named ranges like MyRange.<br>Standard parser rules would dictate that 3:4 is two numeric values with the : operator (which would give a null result), but (only when numbers are used with : they're cell ranges). At least B:B can't be confused as easily, &quot;B&quot; would be a string, B (without the quotes) is always a column range reference, but can only be used with the : operator.<br>And just to confuse still further, Monkey1:Monkey2 is a valid range where Monkey1 and Monkey2 are both named ranges, and named ranges be combined with a column reference when using the : operator, so Monkey:B is also valid [I've not yet tested if my code will handle this case].<br>Then again, the only difference between a named range and a column ref is the length of the string, so IV or ABC are column references (Excel 2007 allows up to 16,384 columns) but ZZZ could be a valid named range... I use an arbitrary 3 character max test for column range and treat anything longer as a named range.</p>\r\n<p>You'll be pleased to know that we actually support the @ prefix before a function</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"border:solid .1em #ccc;font-style:italic;margin:.25em 1em 0 1em;padding:0 .25em 0 .25em\"><strong>JohnGriffiths2 wrote:</strong><br>\r\n<p>Edge cases make basket cases I guess.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>They certainly drive me crazy.<br>But some of the functions are worse. There's a whole level of complexity depending on what is passed to a function. SUM(A1:C3) uses different logic compared with SUM({1,2,3;4,,6;7,8,NULL}) even though A1:C3 might contain exactly the same values as the matrix... and none of these minor idiosyncracies are documented anywhere.</p>",
