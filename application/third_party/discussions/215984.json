I am writing 3 exam grades including other information (about 12 columns) for approximately 100 students for up to 12 worksheets (team-based learning scores or TBL).  When I come across a new TBL session_id I create another worksheet.  This works for those courses that only have 3 or 4 TBL sessions, however the script times out for the larger courses that has many TBL sessions.  All I get is a blank screen.    For each worksheet I setAutoSize and setHorizontal but that is about it.\r\n\r\nFor example Medical Neuroscience has 3 TBL sessions so I have 3 worksheets, but Human Development has 12 TBL sessions so I would have 12 worksheets, but this crashes the script.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.",
