    "Html": "<p>Sorry, it is unfortunately not possible to calculate the final row height in PHPExcel. That would probably require that PHPExcel laid out all the glyphs in the wrapped text to figure out how many lines it occupies based on column width, font, glyph widths, and heights. I have no idea how this could be done.</p>\r\n<p>If someone knows how to do this, please post. It affects not only problems like the one you are describing, but also the creation of xls files when images which are laid over cells containing wrapped text. Images in xls files need two anchor points to be specifed internally in the binary file, and if they are not exact, the image will appear distorted.</p>",
