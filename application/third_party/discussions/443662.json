One problem that I have encountered is how to read or get the value out of a specific cell with a formula like this: =TEXT(E16/1440,&quot;h:mm&quot;)+G15\r<br />\nI tried using getValue() but it returns the actual formula, I also tried using getFormattedValue() and getCalculatedValue() but they all return #VALUE. I hope you can help me in this. :)<br />\n",
