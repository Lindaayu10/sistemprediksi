    "Html": "Is it possible to modify a form using a programming language?  I have a little experience generating XLS and XLSX files using Python but I would like to now modify an XLS template using PHP. Specifically I need to update cells with text data and 'check' checkboxes that are part of forms.  Simply dropping text into cells based on coordinates seems like it will be fairly easy but I am really concerned if it's even possible to alter check-boxes. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.<br />\n",
