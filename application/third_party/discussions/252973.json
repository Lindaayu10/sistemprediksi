Rows that have merged cells in them are automatically adjusted this is great.  But I have some users that are using OpenOffice. This can open xlsx but when cells are merged and auto adjust row heigh is set it doesn't work. The adjust row height works when cells are not merged.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have a suggestion on how to resolve this or would there be a way to work out the heigh a row should be based on text and then set the row height accordingly?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rgds</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>****</p>\n<p>This is what I tried to do.</p>\n<p>1: Remove the merged cells</p>\n<p>2: Populate the cell with data</p>\n<p>3: Get the adjusted ROW height</p>\n<p>4: Merge the two cells and set the row heigh to the returned value from 2: but the returned value is -1 which implies it should be autoadjusting</p>",
