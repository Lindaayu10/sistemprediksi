The images are charts that Crystal exports inside the excel file as an image.

If so, how does one read the position of an image from an existing sheet? I've seen examples of how to extract the image and save it to a file - I should be able to use those examples to get the image data itself, but how does one get the positional data? I would hope that the load and getAllSheets methods would read images without special handling.<br />\n",
