Then, i'm using phpExcelReader to dump it into Access/mySQL as it doesn't support .xlsx.<br>\r\nBut, the converted .xls (say 2) file opens perfectly in Microsoft Excel 2007, but it can't be dumped in Access/mySQL.<br>\r\nAlso, when i save the .xlsx file in .xls format using Excel, then it is dumped into Access/mySQL successfully, without any errors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs there an issue with encoding??? Also, the content of both .xls files are exactly same, but size differs greatly (.xls (say 1) is of 10 KB, whereas .xls (say 2) is of 26 KB!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, suggest me how to read, dump data from excel file to Access/mySQL using phpExcel...</p>\r\n",
