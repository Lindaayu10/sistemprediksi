These names can be 100 names, but can also be 1000 names.<br><br>\r\n\r\n1. Is it possible to insert the array as a row (ofcourse in different columns) all at once?<br>\r\n2. (if not, ) Is it possible to insert 1 name, check what the next column-identifier should be (e.a. the last name was put in A, the next column-identifier should be B) ??<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith one of those solutions I wouldn't get the problem that Z is the column before AA.<br><br>\r\n\r\nVery best regards,<br>\r\nTim<br><br>\r\nedit: fixed linebreaks\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nI have found the functions<br>\r\ncolumnIndexFromString and stringFromColumnIndex<br>\r\nWhich I might be able to use to check what ID is the current column, add 1, and get back the new columnid..<br>\r\nI'm going to break my head on this for a while...",
