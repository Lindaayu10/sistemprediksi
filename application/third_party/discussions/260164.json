I'd imagine it would happen with most extended/special characters but the surname in my query which is causing issues is M&aacute;rquez. The source file is an XLXS file\r\n and I can't find out what version of PHPExcel I'm using but the files are dated mid-February and it it ceratinly this year when I updated.</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, it's displaying fine in Excel and when used with <em>html_entity_decode($v, ENT_QUOTES)</em> the value in my database is\r\n<strong>M&amp;aacute;rquez</strong>. However, the value that is coming out of the PHPExcel reader is\r\n<strong>M&amp;Atilde;&amp;iexcl;rquez</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>I am happy to give more details if required but that might be enough if it's something simple that I'm overlooking. That wouldn't surprise me.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>WorldOfWires</p>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"64\">\r\n<colgroup><col width=\"64\"></colgroup>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr height=\"20\">\r\n<td width=\"64\" height=\"20\" style=\"height:15pt; width:48pt\"><br>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n",
