Perhaps there should also be an online version which can be updated quickly (wiki)? Not sure... Others may have an opinion about this.<br>\r\n",

It would be awesome to have something similar to PHP's manual...where you can look functions up and get examples and user contributions. So far it's been me trying to find my way in the dark, haha.
