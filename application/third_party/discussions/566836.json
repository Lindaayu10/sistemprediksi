We are using it for one of our clients, on a project that would otherwise have been impossible.<br />\n<br />\nIt's been working really well; however, I am running into an infinite loop whenever I encounter a circular reference. I have managed to debug this to some extent, but my resulting value is not the same as in MS Excel. <br />\n<br />\nCould someone please explain to me the algorithm that is used for calculating circular formulas? Is it supposed to be the same algo as MS Excel?<br />\n<br />\nI very much appreciate some assistance with understanding the code. I will be happy to submit my code so far, as well as the fix, once I get it working.<br />\n<br />\nI am using PHPExcel 1.8.0<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance for your help<br />\n",
