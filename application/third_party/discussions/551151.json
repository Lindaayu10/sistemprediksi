    "Html": "I have an Excel 97-04 workbook with one sheet in it.  The sheet has 29 columns in it with a header row followed by X number of data rows.  When I iterate the header row I get all 29 columns. When I iterate through the data rows I only get 26 columns it stops at column &quot;Z&quot;.  If I insert columns before &quot;Z&quot; they will be iterated any columns after &quot;Z&quot; will not.  If I cut column &quot;Z&quot; and insert it as the last column all columns will be iterated.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there something in the spreadsheet could be causing the cell iterator to stop at this particular column?  I see no obvious difference between the column settings.<br />\n",
