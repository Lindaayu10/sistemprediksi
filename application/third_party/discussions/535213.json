I have the following code that generates the file:<br />\n<pre><code>$excel_writer = new PHPExcel_Writer_CSV($this-&gt;_excel);\n\n$excel_writer-&gt;setDelimiter(';');\n\n$excel_writer-&gt;save($this-&gt;_upload_path.$filename);</code></pre>\n\nI don't know what i can do to tell PHPExcel to generate a CSV file in MS-DOS format. Any help would be appreciated!<br />\n",

As far as I'm aware, MS-DOS is an old operating system, not a format for CSV files which aren't restricted to a single operating system. What is different about an MS-DOS format CSV file that isn't standard for other CSV format files?<br />\n",

    "Html": "The problem is that the client we are sending these files to has to open them and then save them as CSV (MS-DOS). This option is available in excel so it's a valid format. I'm still figuring out what the real difference is between CSV (MS-DOS) and &quot;normal&quot; CSV files.\r<br />\n<br />\nFirst I thought it had something to do with delimiters and line endings but after reading <a href=\"http://excelribbon.tips.net/T009508_Comma-Delimited_and_MS-DOS_CSV_Variations.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> I'm not that sure anymore. Looks like you're right and this is only used by old DOS based operating systems.\r<br />\n<br />\nIn the article encoding is mentioned as the real difference. Maybe there lies the solution? Not sure if there's a way to set this type of encoding to the CSV file I'm generating with PHPExcel?<br />\n",
