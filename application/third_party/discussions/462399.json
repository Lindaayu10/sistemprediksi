I am not using a template or doing any reads.\r<br />\n<br />\nDuring the process writing the spreadsheet, cell formatting disappears.  It would seem to be a memory issue but I am not getting any errors thrown and the spreadsheet does get written to the disk so it is not erroring out.  I have tried this with cell caching in place and without.  I have suspended the memory limit.  Same results no matter what.\r<br />\n<br />\nDepending on how I write the formatting (single cell versus range) I get either more or less data formatted properly in my output.  If I do single cell formatting I lose the formatting about 15-20 rows into the sheet.  If I do ranged formatting I can get further but it still eventually disappears.\r<br />\n<br />\nStranger still, further down, the formatting comes back.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe data stays intact.\r<br />\n<br />\nI am posting an image of a test sheet that I wrote on the server to illustrate what I am talking about.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny help is appreciated.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you in advance,\r<br />\n<br />\nRuss\r<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://www.madspiders.com/phpexcel_border_issue.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br />\n",
