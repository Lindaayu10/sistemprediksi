    "Html": "There is not any really good alternative for this. In theory you could apply the style to all the cells in the column, and the spreadsheet would look the same on screen. But it is not the same. When you style cells individually they count as non-empty, but when you style the entire column, it counts as empty and will not force the printer to write tons of blank pages. Therefore we would need the feature from that link I posted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recommend that you style your column giving only the non-empty cells a background color. For example, styling column 'A', rows 1 through 200:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<code>\r\n$sheet-&gt;duplicateStyleArray(<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; array(<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'fill' =&gt; array(<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'type' =&gt; PHPExcel_Style_Fill::FILL_SOLID,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'startcolor' =&gt; array(<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'rgb' =&gt; 'FFDD00',<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ),<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ),<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ),<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'A1:A200'<br>\r\n);<br>\r\n</code>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is probably the best you can do for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
