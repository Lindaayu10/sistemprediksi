    "Html": "Hello, I'm having problems in adding an image to an excel header using PHPExcel... Ordinary text gets added without any problems but header simply doesn't show. When i look at the XML structure of the created of my xls file I can see that the added image is present in the media folder and that is properly referenced in XML using legacyDrawingHF tag but I can't see it when I open the file in Excel. This is my code: <br />\n<pre><code>        $this-&gt;objPHPExcel-&gt;setActiveSheetIndex(0);\n\n        $objDrawing = new PHPExcel_Worksheet_HeaderFooterDrawing();\n        $objDrawing-&gt;setName('Name');\n        $objDrawing-&gt;setDescription('Description');\n        $objDrawing-&gt;setPath(&quot;path&quot;);\n        $objDrawing-&gt;setResizeProportional(true);\n\n\n        $this-&gt;objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getHeaderFooter()-&gt;addImage($objDrawing, PHPExcel_Worksheet_HeaderFooter::IMAGE_HEADER_LEFT);\n\n        $objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($this-&gt;objPHPExcel, 'Excel2007');\n\n        $objWriter-&gt;save('php://output');</code></pre>\n\nAny suggestion what the problem might be?<br />\n",
