    "Html": "<p>The problem is that PHPExcel uses too much memory per cell. Around 1KB per cell. There is some indication that this can be cut down to around one half ~ 500B by introducing a cell supervisor. This is the next thing on the to-do list for the weeks to come. Once this is in place it will be easier to introduce automatic disk caching like you are suggesting. And this would nearly wipe out all memory usage by PHPExcel.</p>",
