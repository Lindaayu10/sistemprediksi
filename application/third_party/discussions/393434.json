Which edition? Is the specification in a useful online format anywhere, or do you just use the PDFs, xml files, etc?</p>",

I try to maintain everything against the second edition and against the ISO standard&nbsp;to ensure full compatibility\r\n with MS Excel 2007, so none of the extended features that were added between the 1st and 3rd versions. Note that there are some minor discrepancies between the defined specification, and the structure used in MS Excel (e.g. Font format elements must be defined\r\n in a specific order, which is contradicted by the standard).</p>\r\n<p>The Strict variant of the standard is not yet fully supported. Microsoft Office 2010 provides read support for ECMA-376, read/write support for ISO/IEC 29500 Transitional, and read support for ISO/IEC 29500 Strict. Microsoft has stated that Office 2013 will\r\n support both read and write of ISO/IEC</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
