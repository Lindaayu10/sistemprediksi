Using a template, I would load the file, throw in some data, and save as an invoice number. Easy peasy.\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever, the client now wants all data in one, unbroken sheet in a single file. Without formatting, this is fairly simple with looping.\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever, if i want to preserve the cell formats from the .xls I am loading, I am struggling to find a way to do this without individually writing these in.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there a way of 'copying' the styles from A1:F55 from an external sheet, for example? If not, how would you suggest getting round this?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for creating such a great library - it's helped me no end in various projects!<br />\n",
