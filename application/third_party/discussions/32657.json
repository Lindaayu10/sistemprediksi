Maybe it will help to run the 14excel5.php demo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you please describe your method for converting to PDF via command line using Openoffice.org since I'm interested in knowing how you are doing it. If that utility is working for you then could you not use OpenOffice 3 beta for converting Excel 2007 format to PDF?<br>\r\n",
