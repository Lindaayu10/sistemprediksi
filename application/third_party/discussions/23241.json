I did 95% of a project with it in no time, thanks again !<br /><br />But I can not set up single cell protection. I have read all discussions and issues and the docus and tried long time, <br />even setting up a default style where the cells are locked didnt seem to work, please help.<br /><br />Short : Whenever I put in a value in a cell, its not longer protected. I want to put in a value and then protect it (again) and then <br />save file.<br /><br />Small example of one way I tried :<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Wiki/View.aspx?title=..\">..</a><br />$ed = new PHPExcel();<br />$ed-&gt;setActiveSheetIndex(0);<br />$ed-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getStyle(\"A1\")-&gt;getNumberFormat()-&gt;setFormatCode(\"0.00\");<br />$ed-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValue(\"A1\", 33.21);<br />$ed-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getStyle('A1')-&gt;getProtection()-&gt;setLocked(PHPExcel<i>Style</i>Protection::PROTECTION_PROTECTED);<br />$ed-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getProtection()-&gt;setSheet(true);<br /><a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Wiki/View.aspx?title=...\">...</a><br /><br />I tried dozens of other ways...default style, order etc..<br /><br />Any help would be highly appreciated.<br />",

(Everything else seem to work fine,<br />well it does not set the meta tags and it puts a PAGESTYLE_ in front of my worksheet title)<br /><br />Problem Description : Fill a a value into a cell and then protect it, not with .xls writer nor xlsx. writer.<br /><br />I tried a lot of ways seeming logically, but even the reference to the tutorial of maarenba did not do the trick.<br /><br />I think the library is not supposed to protect cells that were filled by it.<br /><br />I am reformating the current example of mine to post it here. Perhaps its a little freaking out detail,<br />but I double checked it with all tutorials and sources on the web (even chinese).<br /><br /><br />&lt;before&gt;<br />Then setLocked(PHPExcelStyleProtection::PROTECTION_PROTECTED); IS <b>not</b> WORKING but to UNLOCK cells that were locked with the protectCells.<br />I will use protectCells then.<br />There seem to be no difference between the order of setSheet(). It seems to make no difference if<br />you set setSheet true before or after any security operation.<br />",
