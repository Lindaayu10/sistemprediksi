This text can be from time to time quite long so the PDF version doesn't print all the collumns. (last one is missing cause it's outside the page)</p>\r\n<p>Is there anyway i can configure my collumns to &quot;fit to the page&quot; ?</p>\r\n<p>For now, i configured my columns with:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>$this-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getColumnDimension(PHPExcel_Cell::stringFromColumnIndex($i))-&gt;setAutoSize(true);\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Plus, it seems cell borders aren't working for the PDF writer (have them under Excel5, not on PDF) . Is it normal ?</p>\r\n<p>I'm using version 1.7.1.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks !</p>",
