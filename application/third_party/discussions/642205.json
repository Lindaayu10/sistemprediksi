Very powerful and easy to use.\r<br />\nMy question is: when reading and uploading excel files to mysql database, is there any way of lowering the processing time of reading large files? I have for example an xlsx with 17000 rows and 7 columns to import, and it takes about 28 seconds and uses 450 MB of memory. The client is asking me if the 28 seconds could be lowered somehow. I've searched online for solutions, but I can only find ways of improving memory usage, not processing time.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you in advance and best regards,\r<br />\nDragos<br />\n",
