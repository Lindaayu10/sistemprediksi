Or to convert that number to a valid date?<br />I'm using this code to read the file:<br />$objReader = new PHPExcel<i>Reader</i>Excel2007();<br />$objReader-&gt;setReadDataOnly(true);<br />$objPHPExcel = $objReader-&gt;load($filePath);<br /><br />Thank you very much for your help.<br />Regards.<br />Esteban Eid.<br />",

(which then makes it a PHP date which kan be formatted using, for examle, date()).<br /><br />Another option is to manually assign a date format to that specific cell, and read it out like that.<br />",
