    "Html": "Despite the ability to set many of the style attributes of a cell containing a hyperlink, you cannot achieve the &quot;changing&quot; appearance of a simple hyperlink to mimic one created in Excel 2007.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have added the changes to PHPExcel 1.7.9 to do that.\r<br />\nIn short, the changes are to 3 files in writer/Excel2007;\r<br />\nwriter/Excel2007.php, writer/Excel2007/Styles.php, and writer/Excel2007/Worksheets.php\r<br />\n<br />\nIf you include any hyperlinks on any worksheet, then the writer will emit the additional fonts and styles needed to achieve the Excel 2007 default behavior of a hyperlink.  When the cells are emitted, if the cell is a hyperlink with no other style attributes, then its style will be set to the &quot;builtin&quot; style for a hyperlink.  The result is underlined blue text that turns purple after the link is clicked.\r<br />\n<br />\nI hope you find this useful. The changes files are provided here: \r<br />\n<a href=\"https://phpexcel.codeplex.com/workitem/20242\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://phpexcel.codeplex.com/workitem/20242</a><br />\n",
