My excel documents are millions of cells and while I've done all the optimizations I could find, I'm at the point where I'm just going to accept the length of\r\n time it takes and opt for a progress bar to give users feedback.</p>\r\n<p>I'm wondering if PHPExcel has any metrics cooked in that will let me give progress feedback during the &quot;save&quot; function. It would be super useful if there was a callback of some kind at critical intervals in the process, for external use. Has anyone attempted\r\n this or can recommend anything short of manually adding my own calls into the library?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for any insight.</p>\r\n<p>P.S. Related topic: does anyone know of any other libraries to dump xlsx files without minimal features (speed over everything) BUT support the outline parameter (for folding rows).</p>\r\n",
