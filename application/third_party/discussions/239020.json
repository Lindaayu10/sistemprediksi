Thanks so much</p>\r\n<p>to the developers !!</p>\r\n<p>I have a quick question...is it possible to search a particular row looking for a specific text value, and have the colum it was found in returned. I may want to then delete the column # ??? Or does one need to use the iterator to perform such a task ??</p>\r\n<p>thanks,</p>\r\n<p>walter</p>\r\n",
