However, I've run into an issue I can't seem resolve and was wondering if it's a known bug or whether it's simply not possible to do.</p>\r\n<p>I'm running version 1.7.5 on PHP 5.3.1 (on XAMPP for Windows (7) in a devlopment environment). Most features of PHPExcel work flawlessly and am confident that the confirguation is fine.</p>\r\n<p>I'm trying to import a large spreadsheet from my client to extract just a few columns from a single sheet. The contents of this sheet are dragged in from loads of other sheets which in turn sometimes come from another sheet themselves. It's a convoluted\r\n file but it's my client's format and I'm not in a position to change it.</p>\r\n<p>The fatal error reads:<br>\r\n<strong>Fatal error</strong>: Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'PUBLISHED FARES!L3 -&gt; All Fares!AF5 -&gt; All Fares!T5 -&gt; All Fares!S5 -&gt; Formula Error: Unexpected ,' in Y:\\Documents\\Projects\\Echelon\\trunk\\inc\\classes\\PHPExcel\\PHPExcel\\Cell.php:284\r\n Stack trace: #0 Y:\\Documents\\Projects\\Echelon\\trunk\\htdocs\\ext\\costing\\files\\import.inc.php(79): PHPExcel_Cell-&gt;getCalculatedValue() #1 Y:\\Documents\\Projects\\Echelon\\trunk\\htdocs\\ext\\costing\\import.php(21): import_step_1(Array) #2 Y:\\Documents\\Projects\\Echelon\\trunk\\htdocs\\costing.php(29):\r\n include_once('Y:\\Documents\\Pr...') #3 {main} thrown in <strong>Y:\\Documents\\Projects\\Echelon\\trunk\\inc\\classes\\PHPExcel\\PHPExcel\\Cell.php</strong> on line\r\n<strong>284</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Published Fares sheet is the sheet I am interested in and the S5 cell from the 'All Fares' sheet contains the following formula:\r\n</p>\r\n<pre>=J5*VLOOKUP(P5,Currencies!$A$1:$B$29,2,FALSE)</pre>\r\nI think it's this formula which is throwing the exception but yet it works fine in Excel (both Excel 5 and 2007).\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>I can't post the Excel file publically but am willing to send it to the (wonderful) developers of PHPExcel if it would help. Any help offered will be very much apprecaited, I'm working on a workaround in the meantime and will be able to get it to work but\r\n it would be nice if I could just use this one sheet.<strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<strong>Thanks very much.<br>\r\n</strong></p>\r\n",
