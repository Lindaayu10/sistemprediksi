A work item has been created:<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=7573\">http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=7573</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part with the imprecise columns may be much harder to resolve at the moment. The problem is that in PHPExcel the algorithm for calculating the auto size column width is not yet as sophisticated as the one of MS Office Excel. PHPExcel's algorithm is based on character count and font size while MS Office Excel also takes into account the glyph widths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
