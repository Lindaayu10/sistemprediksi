I'd create a template with tokens in certain cells; these would be identified by some delimiter, e.g. {my_token}.</p>\r\n<p>It looks like the only way to do this is to iterate through each cell in the worksheet and perform the token replacement if the cell value matches.</p>\r\n<p>Does this approach make sense? Is there a better way to do it than what I've described above?</p>\r\n<p>Many thanks!</p>\r\n<p>- Michael</p>\r\n",
