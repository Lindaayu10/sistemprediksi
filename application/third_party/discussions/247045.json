Great Work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am using latest version of PHPExcel (1.7.5) and and PHP of 5.2.x.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow when i am trying to generate very large xlsx file, it will take too much time to create xlsx file, my file has around 500 rows and 649 columns<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am using below code to generate the file....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nfor($s1=0;$s1&lt;$max;$s1&#43;&#43;) <br>\r\n{<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for($s2=0;$s2&lt;$header;$s2&#43;&#43;) <br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValueByColumnAndRow($col, $row, $value[$id[$p]][$s1][$s2]);<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $col &#43;&#43;;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>\r\n}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhere $max is around 20 and $header is around 35, while $value is multidimensional array with all require value to display in xlsx file.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo generate this file it is taking around 15 minutes. <br>\r\nCan you please let me whether am i doing anything wrong?<br>\r\nIf not then why will it take too much time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for Replay...Thanks in Advance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Regards</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>I don't think there's much I can suggest to help speed things up. If there was a simple code change that could cut your 15 minutes down to 1 minute, I'd have made that change months ago. There are a few tricks that you can try when building your worksheet, such as using row/column styling (or applying styles to ranges of cells) rather than setting styles for each individual cell, and applying styles from a style array is faster than issuing a whole series of lines to set several style features. There's also a host of discussions here on the board describing how you can improve performance with the way you write your code.</p>\r\n<p>For example:</p>\r\n<p>If you're using</p>\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\r\n<pre>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValueByColumnAndRow($col, $row, $value[$id[$p]][$s1][$s2]);\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>for every cell that you set, change your code to:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\r\n<pre>$worksheet = $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet();\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>and then within your loop, use</p>\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\r\n<pre>$worksheet-&gt;setCellValueByColumnAndRow($col, $row, $value[$id[$p]][$s1][$s2]);\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>This save the code from having to call getActiveSheet() for every single cell.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively, look at the fromArray() method to populate a number of cells with a single statement; or at&nbsp;call chaining.</p>",
