Now, at least in theory, I can concentrate on those last few problems that I'm having with the charts, and get out a new release which adds the charting in a couple of weeks time.</p>\r\n<p>The problem I've been having is that the chart is always being positioned at the A1 cell in the worksheet, and that multiple charts are being overlaid. Thsi applies both to new charts being added, and read charts being rewritten; but I believe that the problem is in both the reader failing to read the location correctly, and in the writer. As it stands, it isn't much use; and needs to be resolved before the charting code has any value.</p>",

It now works for most types of charts, though there are certain types (stock charts for example) that don't work cleanly.
