So you know that column A is reporting a date, and you know how to manage it.</p>\r\n<p>If you really do not know how the file is (so what are you reading?) you can avoid the \"read data only\", isn't it?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Regarding merged cells, i was thinking more to a \"GetMergedValue\" than to overwrite the GetValue.
