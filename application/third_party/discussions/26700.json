In Excel it works with \"Alt+Enter\", but I haven't found any possibilite to do that with PHPExcel.<br />When I use \\n or \\r\\n or PHP_EOL, it just prints an unknown character, but it doesn't make a line break.<br /><br />Any help would be appreciated. :)<br />",

(and maybe their corresponding functions?)<br /><br />It's not too urgent, since I already was able to find out the correct values, but I think it'might come in handy. :)<br />",
