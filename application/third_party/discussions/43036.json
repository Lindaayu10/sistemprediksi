I found a way to make it work when you copy the first sheet on this discussion board (pasted below), but I suppose then I'd have to clear everything. I try to test out any way I can think of that may work before asking for help...but this one seems easy but I just don't have the resources to make any headway with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n// copy sheet<br>\r\n$page2 = $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;copy();<br>\r\n$page2-&gt;setTitle(&quot;TEST&quot;);<br>\r\n$page2-&gt;setCellValue('B1', 'TEST');<br>\r\n$objPHPExcel-&gt;addSheet($page2);<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is probably a walk in the park for most of you...but I appreciate it :P<br>\r\n",
