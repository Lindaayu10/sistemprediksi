PHPExcel directly writes the file and considers to be given an English format, if you give him a format in another language, when the localized Excel opens the file, it transforms the format and you are strange things.\r<br />\n<br />\nP.S.: It seems to me reading intervention by Mark concerning the possibility of define localized formats, but I no longer remember details and the version concerned.<br />\n",
