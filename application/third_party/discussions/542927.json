    "Html": "I'm using PHPExcel to save large worksheets with tens of thousands of rows over multiple worksheets. As you probably know, PHPExcel takes its time to do that.\r<br />\n<br />\nI've followed the suggestion do to this generation asynchronous: the website user submits a request for a certain report. A cronjob that runs a script every minute checks whether new reports need to be generated and this starts the process. This all works fine.\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever, I would like to report progress on this report generation to the user. The collection of the data itself can take a long time, but I've managed to convert this to a proper indication of the progress. However, the following code:\r<br />\n<br />\n$writer = \\PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($sheet, &quot;Excel2007&quot;);\r<br />\n$writer-&gt;setPreCalculateFormulas(false);\r<br />\n$writer-&gt;save($output_file);\r<br />\n<br />\nalso takes quite a long time. Is there any way to register a callback that is called every now and again with an update on the total progress? A percentage between 0 and 100 would be great, for example, but as long as I can get a proper indication of how far along the saving progress is, that would be great. I can then use this information to report back to the user in the web interface the report is coming along.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for any suggestions.<br />\n",
