I'm trying to use phpexcel to store the members information in an xlsx file, so that the trainers can have acces to these information.<br />\n<br />\nNow my problem comes with the phone numbers:<br />\nI'm using the string data type to keep the eading zeros. I'm not using some number format, because the phone numbers can have different length (fix/mobile, or different countries becaus e we live next to the country border).<br />\nTo insert the information of a new member in the file, I insert a row at the correct place. At that moment, all leading zeros of the rows below get lost. When printing the values of the cells right before, the zeros are still there, but right after the insertion of the row, the zeros disapear, altought the string data type seems to be kept.<br />\n<br />\nI found a fix for the rows above by putting an ' in front of each number, but that didn't  help for the lower rows. (without that ' i.e. only string data type, the leading zeros of the upper rows are also lost.)<br />\n<br />\nCan anyone help me how to keep all the leading zeros?<br />\n<br />\n(my server is running php 5.3 and 'm using phpexcel 1.8.0)<br />\n",
