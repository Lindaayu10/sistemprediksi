Which is the best approach. Which is the best order? <br>\r\na. generate all the sheets , fill data, add formulas, &nbsp; add style<br>\r\nb. for every sheet: add data, add formulas add style<br>\r\nc. generate all the sheets, add style, add formulas, add datas<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm asking this because I need to generate a excel file with 35 sheets, and only generating one empty file with styles it takes me about 1 minute on a dual core procesor with 4GB RAM(in lucky cases...sometimes it croushes).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
