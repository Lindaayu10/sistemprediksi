So I set the font to 6 pts and played with document margins. So, on screen, the sheet is displayed in the right way but not when I print it. Sometimes, the text doesn't fit anymore in some cells and it is cut off. I have to increase the row height manually.\r<br />\n<br />\nI tried some tricks with things like <br />\n<pre><code>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getRowDimension($rowNumber)-&gt;setRowHeight(-1);</code></pre>\n\n...or to change the font but the problem still here.\r<br />\n<br />\nCan someone can give me a hand or just explain to me what I am doing wrong? It would be much appreciated! Thank you very much!<br />\n",
