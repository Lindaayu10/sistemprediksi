The problem is that when I use:</p>\r\n<p>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValue(&quot;F&quot;.$i.&quot;&quot;, utf8_encode($linha['tid']));</p>\r\n<p>Where TID &nbsp;have from 20 digits (number), it sometimes converts the field to date in Excel (it occurs only with some TID numbers). For example:</p>\r\n<p>if the TID is: 100699306905C1962005 it shows in Excel 05/01/1962 &nbsp;07:06:00</p>\r\n<p>if the TID is: 100699306905C1982002 it shows in Excel 02/01/1982 &nbsp;07:06:00</p>\r\n<p>if the TID is: 100699306905C1971001 it shows in Excel 01/01/1971 &nbsp;07:06:00</p>\r\n<p>It does not occur with&nbsp;<span>10366890150000961001 or with&nbsp;<span>10366890150000A82005, that are showed ok.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>The problem is that i cant change the TID numbers format because I receive them from another system.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Anyone know how can I solve it. Could you please help me? I tried a lot of things with no success.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks a lot.</p>\r\n",
