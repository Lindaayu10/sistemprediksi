So I will need to load each sheet in sequence without knowing its name.  Is this possible?\r\n\r\nI know that I can use the following: $objReader-&gt;setLoadSheetsOnly() but I need to know the name of the sheet right? Can I use an index instead?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help\r\n\r\n",

    "Html": "Hi Again..\r\n\r\nI understand that such feature is not available at the moment... so is there a way to get a list of all the worksheets names in a given excel file without loading all the excel file in memory?  I am using the following at the moment:\r\n\r\n$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel2007');\r\n$objReader-&gt;setReadDataOnly(true);\r\n$objPHPExcel = $objReader-&gt;load(&quot;test3.xlsx&quot;); \r\n\r\nBut it is having a big performance issues as the file is quite large.  So what I need is to get the names of each worksheet and then load one worksheet at a time by loading it by name, without loading all the file in the first place.  Is it possible? Or I am asking the impossible :)\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help once again and for a wonderful piece of software!\r\n\r\n",
