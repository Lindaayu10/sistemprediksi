The XLS file works fine, shows the borders.  But the PDF shows lines even for the cells that do not have borders.\r<br />\n<br />\nI tried Hide Gridlines, but that hid even the borders of the cells.  I've Googled everywhere for a solution, but other than manually setting borders for every cell I write content into, I can't seem to retain the borders in my template without including lines on the spaces as well.\r<br />\n<br />\nAnyone know how to help?<br />\n",
