    "Html": "<p>Just thought that I would post that I solved the issue (with one minor unanswered question).&nbsp; It <em>was </em>a character encoding issue.&nbsp; I used the iconv() function as suggested in the documentation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The database data being used to populate the spreadsheet had a 'latin_swedish_ci' collation, which corresponds to a 'cp1252' encoding.</p>\r\n<p>The weird thing was that on my local server it did not have an issue, even though the local server database uses the same encodings.&nbsp; I am not sure if Apache is doing something behind the scenes, because when I changed the code to use iconv(), it still works on both servers.&nbsp; I would be interested in anybody's thoughts as to why this could be.</p>\r\n<p>Anyhow, one other thing to point out that might be helpful to users is that most of the forum posts here and elsewhere regarding using iconv() or utf8-encode() seem to suggest that most data from Windows would be in a <span>'ISO-8859-1' encoding.&nbsp; It should be noted that for data pulled from MySQL, you are more likely to have 'cp1252'.&nbsp; Since these two encodings are very close, using utf8-encode() eliminated the truncation problem, but not the character conversion problem.</span></p>",
