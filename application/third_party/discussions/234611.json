When PHPExcel writes a cell containing a formula, by default it writes both the formula and the result of the calculation... and the more data that is included in that calculation, the longer it will take to calculate\r\n the value. You can change this default behaviour, so that PHPExcel doesn't calculate the result when writing.</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, <span style=\"color:#a31515\">'Excel5'</span>);\r\n$objWriter-&gt;setPreCalculateFormulas(false);\r\n$objWriter-&gt;save(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'myExcelFile.xls'</span>);\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Increasing PHP's max execution time to 600 seconds won't make much difference if Apache is still limiting you to 300 seconds.</p>\r\n",
