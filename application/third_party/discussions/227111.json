    "Html": "<p>Processing this through the Evaluator tool in Excel, the 0 value is the correct return for Excel when&nbsp;a cell is blank, but the referenced worksheet still exists: if the referenced worksheet doesn't exist, then Excel will return a #REF! error. By default, this will be displayed as a 0. So the result for a formula of =IV65535 will display as 0 in Excel if IV65535 isn't populated. Likewise, if sheet2 exists, then the formula =Sheet2!IV65535 will return a 0; but =Sheet999!IV65535 will return a #REF! error (assuming Sheet999 does not exist)</p>\r\n<p>The behaviour of PHPExcel isn't strictly correct here. If the referenced cell is in the current worksheet, then PHPExcel correctly returns a NULL; but it always returns a #REF! error if the cell reference is in another worksheet, but doesn't exist, even if the referenced worksheet itself is valid. This behaviour needs modifying to return a NULL if the worksheet exists, and only to return a #REF! error if the referenced worksheet doesn't exist</p>",
