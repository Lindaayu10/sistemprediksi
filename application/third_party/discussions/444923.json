All I'm doing is reading data from an Excel 2007 spreadsheet. I've executed my script a number of times and discovered it takes a very long time for PHPExcel to load/read the spreadsheet. This last time I ran it, I timed it. It took 32 minutes. I need to loop through multiple rows, but I'm only going through a single row at the moment. Is it typical for it to take this long? It just seems too long to be normal.<br />\n",
