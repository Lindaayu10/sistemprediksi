I've also set the permissions to 777. I then went through the file line by line and found that it works fine up to 109 records but as soon as I have 110 records it breaks. <br style=\"font-size:20px;line-height:24px\"></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size:20px;line-height:24px\">What else might keep me from uploading the file?<br style=\"font-size:20px;line-height:24px\"></p>",
