There are no licencing issues with doing this, and it frees a lot of disk space (if this is critical).</p>\r\n<p>If you wanted to really clean everything up, you could also delete /Classes/PHPExcel/Writer/PDF.php as well. There are PDF references in /Classes/PHPExcel/Writer/HTML.php, but you shouldn't need to worry about these.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I've been <a href=\"http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=242617\">\r\npolling </a>for whether we should retain tcPDF as part of the PHPExcel distribution, or simply provide a set of wrappers to the more popular PDF writer classes (allowing developers to install their preferred PDF writer library independently and simply configure\r\n PHPExcel to work with that)... but so far I have had absolutely no feedback at all.</p>\r\n",

PHP world does not have anything similar.</p>\r\n<p>One of my client wants that he clicks the print button it should automatically print the report without even showing report (in any format, HTML / EXCEL or PDF nothing straight to the printer), which i believe is not possible with current browsers.</p>\r\n<p>Sudesh</p>\r\n",
