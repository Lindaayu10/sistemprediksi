    "Html": "<p>It isn't a good idea storing a PHPExcel object in APC.</p>\r\n<p>Storing an object in APC requires that the object be serialised... a function performed automatically by APC. However, a PHPExcel object comprises a series of nested objects that contain cyclic references (e.g. a worksheet object references cell objects, and the cell objects reference their parent worksheet). This cyclic relationship causes problems in PHP when the objects are unserialized (when read from APC) because the unserialize function creates a new parent object for every child object rather than linking correctly to a single parent object.</p>",
