I currently encounter a problem with a formula.<br>\r\nThe formula in question:</p>\r\n<p>$formula = '=IF(ISNA(VLOOKUP(F:F,References!$A$1:$B$4,2,FALSE)),&quot;&quot;,VLOOKUP(F:F,References!$A$1:$B$4,2,FALSE))';</p>\r\n<p>I write in English in my PHP code for the locale defaults to 'en_us'. When I open my Excel file (in French), the formula is correctly written in French and it works.<br>\r\nMy problem is when I try to read the generated Excel file via the command:</p>\r\n<p>$this-&gt;objPHPExcelSheet-&gt;getCellByColumnAndRow($column, $row)-&gt;getCalculatedValue();</p>\r\n<p>I get the value &quot;#REF!&quot;. It can not calculate the formula, because there is a reference problem. In fact, my formula uses another spreadsheet called &quot;References&quot;.<br>\r\nCan you help me?</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\nThank you very much.</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>Technically this is correct behaviour, because PHPExcel cannot calculate a formula that references data that it is unable to access.</p>\r\n<p>A possible solution for this was included in the 1.7.7 release, where (if it encountered an external reference in a formula) it would fall back to the last calculated value from when the file was accessed in MS Excel itself. This is not a guaranteed solution, as it is possible to disable autocalculation in MS Excel, or if the external spreadsheet had subsequently been updated) but it is a best possible solution for this issue.</p>",

In my debug log, I recovered each time the value of the cell \"F1\" and not the \"F\" value of the current line. After a few corrections from right to left in my code, it works very well.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you!</p>",
