    "Html": "I have downloaded the most current Dev release of PHPExcel (as of 1:00PM CDT on 2/23/14). \r<br />\n<br />\nI am cloning a worksheet in my template file that contains numerous excel text boxes. Everything seems to clone properly EXCEPT the text boxes. \r<br />\n<br />\nMy initial thought was this could be caused because PHPExcel is viewing the text boxes as images. What doesn't make sense is that I have separate images in the worksheet that clone/copy just fine. So, I am not sure what to think. It seems only the text boxes themselves are problematic.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs this a known issue?\r<br />\n<br />\nMore importantly.... Is there a workaround to support cloning of text boxes?\r<br />\n<br />\nIf there is no current solution or workaround, is this functionality on the 'radar' to be added in the future?\r<br />\n<br />\nI appreciate any and all feedback.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance!<br />\n",
