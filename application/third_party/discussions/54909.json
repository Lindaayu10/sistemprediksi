    "Html": "Hi,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am facing strange problem. The date in some rows is coming corrupt after 4000 records in the Excel 5 format. The filed in which data is coming corrupt is date field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso once data comes corrupt in date field for 5 to 6 records all date fields upto end comes empty . Also name field which is in japanese also come empty in many records. Can this be a problem of large number of records (7041 in my case) or Japanese text problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have earlier used Spreadsheet_excel_writer class for creating excel but in that I was getting error in SST problems after 200 records for which I have shifted to PHP_Excel class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny help will be appreciated.<br>\r\n",
