Depending on the days in the month I am removing rows from the 31 day template file but the chart data series do not update with the deletion of the rows (as in Excel).  Is there any way I can programmatically change the dataseries ranges for an existing chart with PHPExcel?<br />\n<br />\nThanks<br />\n",
