I guess if I can create my own code that creates a spreadsheet from scratch this is better (right??) as then I do not have to rely on the template. so other then the time and easy editing of the base format a tempalte might save, if I got down to it and created the code that can generate the tempalte from scratch that is better, right?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I'll use the excuse again that I'm quite new to this so maybe asking basic stuff, just want to verify my assumptions.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks again!</p>",

For example, it is much faster to make changes in the tempate if you are confident with Excel.</p>\r\n<p><em>&gt;&gt; if I got down to it and created the code that can generate the tempalte from scratch that is better, right?</em></p>\r\n<p>It is not necessarily better to create code from scratch than using a template. I would say it is largely a matter of taste.</p>\r\n<p>If you are worrying about speed, I think there is not much difference anymore. No matter the approach, virtually the same thing is happening under the hood.</p>",
