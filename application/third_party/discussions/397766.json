    "Html": "<p>Thanks for the quick reply, Mark.&nbsp; You are correct in that the #REF seems to be an issue with BIFF formatted files but I've created files sans the Analysis Toolpack addon and it still occurs.&nbsp; Here's an example of what I'm seeing:&nbsp; I've created two blank Excel workbooks, Book1, Book2.&nbsp; Cell \"A1\" in Book2 references cell \"A1\" in Book1. Very simple external reference example.&nbsp; I save both workbooks in the following formats: BIFF(xls), 2007XML(xlsx), 2003XML(xml).&nbsp; The results of calling getValue(\"A1\") on Book2 results in the following results respectively:</p>\r\n<p>BIFF(xls):&nbsp; =#REF!</p>\r\n<p>2007XML(xlsx):&nbsp; =[1]Sheet1!$A$1</p>\r\n<p>2003XML(xml): '\\Users\\Mike\\Desktop\\[Book1.xml]Sheet1'!A1</p>\r\n<p>It appears that the only format that truly returns the actual formula with the external reference string is the 2003XML format.&nbsp; Sans the ability to open a BIFF file and save it as a 2003XML file there doesn't seem to be any way for me to grab the underlying formula out of a BIFF file.&nbsp; Is there any work around you can think of?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>",
