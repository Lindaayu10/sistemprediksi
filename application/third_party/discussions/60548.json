I'm using PHPExcel to generate a spreadsheet on the fly. &nbsp;It works perfect in all of my test enviornments but when I went to production, all it does is give garbage text on the screen instead of prompting for the download. &nbsp;I try really hard to keep my environments the same, but something may have happened. &nbsp;I assumed it would be a mime issue, but I can't figure anything out. &nbsp;Any suggestions?</p>",
