    "Html": "I have a formatting issue with Excel with some ID's. For instance, &quot;207375933158&quot; will display as &quot;2.07376E+11&quot; - it does it for all of the IDs within the 20737* range, but not others (like &quot;44533114719&quot; will display just fine). I've tried casting the number as an int with PHP (&quot; $ID = (integer)207375933158);&quot;) although, some of you may know that this will only work on numbers below 2147483648 - then it casts it as &quot;float&quot; - which will not work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn PHPExcel, I tried the following:<br>\r\n$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getCell('H' . $cellnum)-&gt;setValueExplicit($ID, PHPExcel_Cell_DataType::TYPE_NUMERIC);<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo go, does the same thing. Oddly enough, when I manually format the cell column as &quot;Number&quot; then it formats to how it should. Am I using the wrong TYPE?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, I'm out of ideas...maybe I just have to tell the executives &quot;you'll just have to manually set the field every time you open a fresh document...&quot; - which sucks, because one of the big reasons I tried this system out was because of the ability to define the data type. I really hope someone has at least a few ideas to try...if not the solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you!<br>\r\n",
