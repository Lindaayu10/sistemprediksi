I am posting the topic here rather than on the “Improve CodePlex”-page because PHPExcel is the only project here on Codeplex that currently has my interest. (Haven't even visited any of the other projects.) Indeed, it looks like the majority of the users who are posting here have signed up only for this particular project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is frustrating me is this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Searches are too slow (60 seconds when I search in the “Issue tracker” on “All Issues”)</li>\r\n    <li>No formatting available for “Add Comment” in “Issue Tracker”. Not even possible to include hyperlinks. As far as I understand, it is not even possible to add this feature due to limitations in the so-called &quot;Team Foundation Server&quot;.</li>\r\n    <li>No way to attach a file in discussion topics.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br>\r\nCodeplex did look promising at first sight when I saw rounded corners and gradient backgrounds etc. It looked like they had tried to perfection the layout. Now I wish that they instead had concentrated efforts on usability and done appropriate testing before launching this site.\r\n",
