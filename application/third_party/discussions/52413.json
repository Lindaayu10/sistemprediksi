Codeplex is just a project hosting website that is provided by Microsoft, but they have nothing to do with the projects themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor our 1.6.7 release (we hope to get it in in time), we are doing some investments in reducing memory usage and improving speed. This is mainly caused by circular references in PHP not being handled correctly by the parser. We are now working on a rewrite of the PHPExcel_Style_* classes to prevent this behaviour from happening, sharing styles between multiple cells automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelated work item: <a href=\"http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=6857\">http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=6857</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing we are working on is an improved version of the formula parser, providing faster and more accurate results for formula calculation.
