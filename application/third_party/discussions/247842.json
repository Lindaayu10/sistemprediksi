Everything it's ok, BUT when I try to merge some cells (every 2 columns, only first 3 rows), I am running out of memory. I can set style on every cell, colors, borders,\r\n everything, without running out of memory, it happens only when I try to merge more than 100 cells. PHP memory on my server it's 1024MB, a huge value, for such a small excel file (about 300kb for xlsx). I had try all caching options and everything that I found\r\n in documentation, but without succes. What should I do? Thanks</p>\r\n",
