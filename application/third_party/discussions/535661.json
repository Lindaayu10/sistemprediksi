Instead of writing the excel file to disk, i am pushing to client browser realtime in the following way:<br />\n<br />\n_header(&quot;Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel&quot;);<br />\nheader(&quot;Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=$report_filename&quot;);<br />\nheader(&quot;Cache-Control: max-age=0&quot;);<br />\n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel5');<br />\n$objWriter-&gt;save('php://output');_<br />\n<br />\nWith this much data the Excel generation now shows memory out error. The original php.ini is set with '<strong>memory_limit=1528M</strong>'<br />\n<br />\nIn this situation, what do you gurus suggest to overcome the memory limit issue other than increasing the limit?<br />\n<br />\nThanks,<br />\nJustine<br />\n",
