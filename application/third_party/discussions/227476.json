If you can, I'll ensure that it is removed.</p>\r\n<p>There are limits to the amount of memory that PHP can use (although these can be changed if your host permits); and PHPExcel can easily exceed this with large workbooks. But even without changing memory, PHPExcel can now work with larger workbooks (typically up to 3 times larger) with the changes that have been implemented since 1.7.0.</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively, Excel has its own limits, and the PHPExcel Writers will prevent you writing more rows or columns than are permitted by the appropriate version of Excel. So the Excel5 Writer (for example) prevents you writing more than 65536 rows or 255 columns in any worksheet.</p>",
