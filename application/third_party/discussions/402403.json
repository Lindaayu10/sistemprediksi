Directing your ZipArchive to the PHPExcel built-in zip archive (add 'PHPExcel_Settings::setZipClass(PHPExcel_Settings::PCLZIP);' before the call to the save function) will solve the problem with writing excel files in Excel2007 format. The only problem that exists is the fact that some unreadable content will be included causing excel to give a warning on opening the file, asking to repair the file. Just say 'yes' and you will have a readable excel file. Something to correct in future versions?<br />\n",
