    "Html": "I am pulling in data from a mysql query and populating a spreadsheet.  Everything seems to work well except I notice on one of the fields that I import, when the data comes in to the spreadsheet sometimes I only get FALSE as the data, and not the text data.  I did some troubleshooting and it looks like when folks have put in characters like -, &quot;&quot;, that is when the information comes in as FALSE.  I know this because I have taken out some of those characters in the text and sub-stringed the text and all the text comes in until I sub-string to the next special character in which case I get FALSE again.  I saw some threads about utf-8 so for my code I put in the following:<br />\n<br />\nif ($mysqli-&gt;multi_query($sql1)){<br />\n<pre><code>do {\n  $mysqli-&gt;set_charset('utf8');\n  if ($result = $mysqli-&gt;store_result()){\n      $titlerow = $result-&gt;fetch_row();\n      $eventtitle=$titlerow[2];</code></pre>\n\nbut that did not see to make a difference.  I then tried to add the utf-8 to the header:<br />\n<br />\nheader('Content-Type:application/vnd.ms-excel; charset=utf-8');<br />\n<br />\nand this did not help.  How do I get PHP to pull in the text as just a string?  I even made sure my db was utf-8 which it is.<br />\n<br />\nSorry, forgot to mention we are on PHP version 5.5.9, PHPExcel version 1.8.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThanks for any insight to this.<br />\n",
