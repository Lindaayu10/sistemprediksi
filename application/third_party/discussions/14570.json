Apparently we need to apply a <i>applyProtection=\"1\"</i> attribute to the relevant &lt;xf&gt; tag of styles.xml. The same &lt;xf&gt; tag should also contain an <i>&lt;protection locked=\"0\"/&gt;</i> tag.<br /><br />After doing this, one would apply sheet protection as is already implemented in PHPExcel.<br /><br />Do you think this would work? I will try and implement it and then of course offer the code if it can be useful.<br />",
