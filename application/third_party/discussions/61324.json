    "Html": "<p>The problem is that in PHP the included file is taken relative to the executed script, not relative to the file where the include statement occurs. If A includes B and B includes C, then your method will not work in general if A and B are in different directories. This is a big pain in PHP.<br> <br> One can get around this problem by using absolute path together with magical constant <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">__FILE__</span><br> <br> <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">require_once dirname(__FILE__) . '/IWriter.php';</span><br> <br> This is perhaps an option, and one would not have to set up an include path. Last time I looked at this, I came across posts saying that this was bad practice presumably because of extra function calls with <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">dirname(__FILE__)</span>. But how much will this be slowing down the script?<br> <br> Maybe we should discuss this option. I agree that it is annoying to deal with include paths. Maybe Maarten or Mark has an opinion about this.</p>",
