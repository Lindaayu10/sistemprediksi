I think this is something to be seriously considered by the project management as it is thin ice to move on.<br>I know this relation is not obvious - but e.g. that was one of the reasons to rename the OSS software phpSurveyor to LimeSurvey. It could also stall adoption by third-party applications as they may commit the same license violation unknowingly.</p>\r\n<p>Best regards</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Carsten</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

In the latter case, I contacted the authors about its usage; and we have explicit written (e-mail) permission from Paul Meagher (the&nbsp;main author) to use JAMA however we like, even change the license if we want. That permission allows us to use the library within PHPExcel without worrying about the name.</p>\r\n<p>I think we need to wait on Maarten's return from vacation before making any comment on the OLE license, although I am aware of an independent&nbsp;port of Kawai Takanori's OLE::Storage_Lite Perl package to PHP that is licensed under LGPL if it did become necessary to make any change.</p>",
