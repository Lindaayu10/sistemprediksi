Given that:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>AJ11 = 4000 </li>\n<li>AY16 = &quot;=AM16&lt;=AJ13&quot; </li>\n<li>AM16 = 100</li>\n<li>\nAJ13 = 3000<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nI debug this cell with the function that Mark Baker posted months ago that function named &quot;testFormula&quot; and it shows like that:<br />\n<pre><code>Formula Value is=AJ11&lt;AY16\nExpected Value is UNKNOWN\nParser Stack :-\nArray\n(\n    [0] =&gt; Array\n        (\n            [type] =&gt; Cell Reference\n            [value] =&gt; AJ11\n            [reference] =&gt; AJ11\n        )\n\n    [1] =&gt; Array\n        (\n            [type] =&gt; Cell Reference\n            [value] =&gt; AY16\n            [reference] =&gt; AY16\n        )\n\n    [2] =&gt; Array\n        (\n            [type] =&gt; Binary Operator\n            [value] =&gt; &lt;\n            [reference] =&gt; \n        )\n\n)\n\nCalculated Value is </code></pre>\n\nI'm going crazy with this problem because that calculations are crucial.<br />\n",
