    "Html": "I've got some issues when setting cells with special characters (as á, é, í, etc.). If I do it directly with &quot;setCellValue&quot; it's ok, but when I'm trying to do it with  the function &quot;fromArray&quot; it sets the cell as &quot;FALSE&quot;. My array is defined this way:<br />\n<pre><code>foreach ($reporte-&gt;result() as $fila) {\n    $datosReporte[] = array(\n            'Fecha'             =&gt; $fila-&gt;NombreDia.&quot; &quot;.$fila-&gt;Fecha, \n            'Horario'           =&gt; $fila-&gt;HoraEntrada.&quot; - &quot;.$fila-&gt;HoraSalida,\n            'Entrada'           =&gt; $fila-&gt;ChecadaEntrada,\n            'Salida'            =&gt; $fila-&gt;ChecadaSalida,\n            'Incidencia'        =&gt; utf8_encode($fila-&gt;Tipo)\n    );  \n}</code></pre>\n\nSo the value &quot;Incidencia&quot;, which is the one I have problems with, is already encoded. I have also checked the file encoding in Sublime Text 2 and it shows UTF-8 as well. Any ideas what might be the problem? <br />\n",

Thank you.<br />\n",
