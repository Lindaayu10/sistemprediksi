    "Html": "<p>@do you think that I can get it by customizing myself?</p>\r\n<p>Depends on a lot of factors, including how comfortable you feel delving into the inwards of PHPExcel and tcpdf.</p>\r\n<p>The PDF writer actually generates an HTML output first, then converts that HTML to PDF. Because the HTML is a single page, and it's the PDF writer that then breaks it down into sheets of A4/Letter size or whatever paper size you're using, the PDF writer handles all the paging, and would need to interpret the header/footer settings from the PHPExcel object. Lines 270/271 of the PDF writer explicitely disable printing or headers/footers. Code would need to enable this, and also set the header/footer to print using the tcpdf setHeaderData() and footer methods based on the PHPExcel_Worksheet_HeaderFooter settings.</p>",
