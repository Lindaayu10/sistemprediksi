There's also data in the source file that has font color as automatic that copies over without any issue.</p>\r\n<p>I'm completely baffled by it - am I missing something here?</p>",

I think this may not actually be a bug.<br><br>When you copy and paste from one Excel document to another, then you will notice similar behavior if the documents are using different themes. But there are &quot;<a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/291358\">Paste Options</a>&quot;, and if you choose the option <em>&quot;Keep source formatting&quot;</em> after pasting, then the original colors are preserved.<br><br>With that said, Excel5 writer could perhaps do a better job. There are some built-in color codes in Excel, and if some of those are used, then this could perhaps be avoided for some of the colors: black, white, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan. Will investigate if we can tweak Excel5 writer a bit and post back here.</p>",
