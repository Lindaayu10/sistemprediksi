It's being used in a calculation on a later cell but not at this point.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe code that writes that (and other blank cells) is this: $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;SetCellValue(number_to_letter($columnkey + 1) . ($rowkey + $datarowincrement), '');\r<br />\n<br />\nI also tried SetCellValueExplicit but got the same error and I verified that my number_to_letter function is properly coming up with cell I2.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks to anyone who can point me in the right direction!<br />\n",
