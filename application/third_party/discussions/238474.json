I also added an image to the file. When I got the downloaded file, it has 900 rows\r\n and 24 columns. Any help would be much appreciated as I badly needed the solution for this one. Thank you very much.</p>\r\n",

If you need anything faster than that, then I suggest you look at commercial solutions such as\r\n<a href=\"http://www.libxl.com/\">libXL</a> with Ilia Alshanetsky's <a href=\"https://github.com/iliaal/php_excel\">\r\nPHP_Excel extension</a>, or COM if you're running on a Windows server.</p>\r\n",

Version 1.7.5 has been heavily optimised to improve speed, but it can never be instantaneous. While 30 minutes\r\n is an excessive time for a small worksheet, there is little more that we can do to speed things up without rewriting in C or similar.</p>\r\n",
