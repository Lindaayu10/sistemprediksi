It will export the file (CSV and Excel), but when opened in Excel it creates errors (I think someone else asked about this in February, but I didn't see a reply).\r<br />\n<br />\nThe exact error that Excel 2010 gives is:\r<br />\nExcel found unreadable content in 'blahblahblah.xlsx'. Do you want to recover the contents of this workbook? If you trust the source of this workbook, click Yes.\r<br />\n<br />\nClicking Yes...\r<br />\nThe file is corrupt and cannot be opened.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen I view the files (turn to .zip and open the .xml contents), I can see that everything is properly formatted.  The UTF-8 characters show up in my text editor (an accented &quot;o&quot; shows up as xC3 as a single item), but those encodings seem to kill Excel.<br />\n",
