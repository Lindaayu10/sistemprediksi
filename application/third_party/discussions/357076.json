The roadmap lists that we're planning on breaking this dependency on tcPDF and allowing the option of your selecting from any of three different 3rd-party libraries (tcPDF, DomPDF&nbsp;or mPDF) to use as the PDF renderer. Hopefully, one of these will give better results, although each has its own problems as well.</p>\r\n<p>This change is planned for the next release.</p>",
