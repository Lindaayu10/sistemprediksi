Rows are numbered from 1 to 65536 (for xls files up to Excel 2003) or 1048576 (for xlsx files Excel 2007 and above).\r\n Columns are identified by the letters A through Z, followed by AA through AZ, BA through BZ, up to IV (for xls files up to Excel 2003) or XFD (for xlsx files Excel 2007 and above). So does PHPExcel.</p>\r\n<p>However, your sample spreadsheet seems to confuse rows and columns.</p>\r\n<table border=\"1\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td><strong>Column A</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>Column B</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>Column C</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Row 1</strong></td>\r\n<td>Cell A1</td>\r\n<td>Cell B1</td>\r\n<td>Cell C1</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Row 2</strong></td>\r\n<td>Cell A2</td>\r\n<td>Cell B2</td>\r\n<td>Cell C2</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Row 3</strong></td>\r\n<td>Cell A3</td>\r\n<td>Cell B3</td>\r\n<td>Cell C3</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<blockquote style=\"border:solid .1em #ccc; font-style:italic; margin:.25em 1em 0 1em; padding:0 .25em 0 .25em\">\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>scanreg wrote:</strong></p>\r\n<p>We need the output to match row-by-row order above</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>I'm not sure exactly what you mean by &quot;going in&quot; and &quot;extracted&quot;, but is there any reason why you think that PHPExcel&nbsp;might not follow the same cell addressing sequence as Excel itself? The PHPExcel Writers write out each row in turn, and each column\r\n within that row in turn. When a program that can read Excel files (such as MS Excel, Open Office Calc, or Gnumeric) reads a file generated by PHPExcel, it will ensure that the cells are displayed&nbsp;in the appropriate rows and columns.</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"border:solid .1em #ccc; font-style:italic; margin:.25em 1em 0 1em; padding:0 .25em 0 .25em\">\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>scanreg wrote:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Is there any code that can make sure that the order of the rows is the same going in as when extracted?</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>If you're unsure, you can try for yourself.</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively, one of the benefits of Open Source is that you can always see how it works by examining the source code.</p>\r\n",
