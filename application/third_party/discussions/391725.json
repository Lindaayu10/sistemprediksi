And, if you look at the formula in the Formula Bar at the top of your spreadsheet, you will see that Excel added the curly brackets to the formula and it looks like this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>{=SUM((A2:A11&gt;500)*(A2:A11))&#43;SUM((A2:A11&lt;300)*(A2:A11))}&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n",

The first step is deprecation of a couple of methods which is planned for this weekend's release. Second step is the changes to methods for setting/getting formulae/values, together with some additions to the cell properties to map array formula references for the 1.7.9 release (probably in October). Then there's a major rewrite of the calculation engine to follow, so it will be early next year before PHPExcel can fully handle array formulae.</p>",
