Because I have all data stored as UTF-8 and the tool creates a Excel-File the file will be written in the standard charset definition. This implies that special chars are not recognized in the excel, and displayed as unknown chars. Can anybody help me?<br />",

If the script uses different encoding then it is possible to convert the texts with PHP's iconv() function.<br /><br />Excel5 writer probably does not support UTF8 encoding, which means you will need to fall back to single byte characters for that output purpose...<br />",
