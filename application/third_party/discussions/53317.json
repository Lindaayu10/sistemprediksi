    "Html": "Hello! I have a trouble with generated PDF files with cyrillis words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI generat <em>$objPHPExcel</em> with Russian words&nbsp;in cells. To let it be displayed in Excel properly, I convert words from native CP1251 (windows-1251) to <em>UTF8:&nbsp; mb_convert_encoding($text, 'UTF8', 'CP1251')</em>. It works and displayed correctly both in Excel2007 and Excel5. Then I create PDF using <em>PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'PDF');.&nbsp; </em>PDF file creates successfully but! Russian words are displayed like multiple question marks (&quot;?&quot; symbols). I suppose that PDF is created without necessary fonts. I look through the created file and found:<br>\r\n<em>/BaseFont /Helvetica-Bold<br>\r\n/Subtype /Type1<br>\r\n/Encoding /WinAnsiEncoding<br>\r\n</em><br>\r\nAs far as I know, WinAnsiEncoding has no russian letters in it. WinAnsi is 1252 - west europen charset, but I need 1251.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>public function __construct($orientation='P', $unit='mm', $format='A4', $unicode=true, $encoding='UTF-8', $diskcache=false) {..</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I changed <em>$unicode</em> to <em>false</em> and <em>$encoding</em> to cp1251 (<em>windows-1251</em>) thinking that necessary encoding will be set. But I was wrong. It makes almost no effect. Multiple question marks just replaced with symbols like.... like &quot;N Ñ&quot; in spanish (with tilde ~ above it), strikethrough &quot;D Ð&quot;, bold dots between symbols and others..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you advice me something on how to generate PDF with russian words in it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can send created files on email if it needed. Just let me know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
