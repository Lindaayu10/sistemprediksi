I'm trying to export all products from my database and convert it in to 2007 Excel file. If I put in my MySQL query  LIMIT 392, everything is ok. The log for this is: Peak memory usage: 43 MB. But for all products export, ~4000 items, I have a problem. When I try to open the resulted file, the error messages is in the fallow images:</p>\r\n<p>http://chiriluta.ro/x/error1.jpg</p>\r\n<p>http://chiriluta.ro/x/error2.jpg</p>\r\n<p>and this is the rezulted excel file:</p>\r\n<p>http://chiriluta.ro/x/excel_file.xlsx</p>\r\n<p>In my php script, I use</p>\r\n<p>ini_set('memory_limit', -1);<br>set_time_limit(0);</p>\r\n<p>but this doesn't help me so much..</p>\r\n<p>The problem exist just on a public hosting server, in my http://localhost everything is ok.</p>\r\n<p>So, that's all..

Can you post that one?<br> <br> The usual cause of encoding errors when retrieving from MySQL database is that data isn't retrieved as UTF-8.

If you change the extension from <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">.xlsx</span> file to <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">.zip</span>, unzip it and inspect <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">xl/sharedStrings.xml</span> at the position it is complaining about you will notice symbol &quot;&reg;&quot; which is encoded as ISO-8859-1 when it should really be UTF-8<br> <br> <em>&gt;&gt; But I don't think the problem is from here. My database have MySQL charset:<strong><br> &gt;&gt; UTF-8 Unicode (utf8)</strong></em><br> <br> It is the connection character set between PHP and MySQL that is the problem. Not the database character set. By default connection characer set is ISO-8859-1 which is annoying for those who prefer UTF-8. Look at that thread I linked to, it will solve your problem.<br> <br> P.S. What version of PHPExcel are you using? I think you are not using PHPExcel 1.7.0. There are many improvements, please try it, it also strips illegal UTF-8 characters so you will not experience this problem.</p>",
