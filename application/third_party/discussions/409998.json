I normally don't have any sort of problems reading values from the excel spreadsheets, but one particular cell (and\r\n as fate would have it, it's a necessary information) refuses to be read, no matter what I do. The reason for that is that it's protection is set to locked, which makes the getValue and/or getFormattedValue always return null (even though worksheet and spreadsheet\r\n protection is turned off).</p>\r\n<p>I've tried this:</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>$feuilleStub-&gt;getStyle(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'E6'</span>)-&gt;getProtection()-&gt;setLocked(PHPExcel_Style_Protection::PROTECTION_UNPROTECTED);\r\n<span style=\"color:blue\">echo</span> $feuilleStub-&gt;getCellByColumnAndRow(4,5)-&gt;getValue();\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Given that I have well over 300 files to process and that a spot-check revealed all of the files have that specific cell set to locked, I can't very well open each file up and remove the attribute by hand. So what am I supposed to do here?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance,</p>\r\n<p>Osu</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "\r\n<p>Faut croire qu'on est tous les deux francophones he he he ;). Anyway, pour répondre aux questions (je vais le faire en anglais pour en faire bénéficier le maximum de monde):</p>\r\n<p>1) Your documentation specify three levels of protection. One on the file, one on the sheet and one on the cell. The only one that's defined is the one on the cell (the dreaded 'locked' attribute. Of course, in the software itself, it says that if sheet\r\n protection is activated, this should have no effect whatsoever, but apparently it has for PHPExcel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) The cell itself contains a date in custom format that displays them this way: 1 august 2009. Though I tried accessing different cells on the same line which are all String format and I can't get the value for the exact same reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) I do believe the workbooks are automatically generated, but I don't know how exactly since I get them from a client website and they're rather protective of their infrastructure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) The file is in XLS format (which is correctly identified with Excel5 by PHPExcel).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) In addition, I have specified a filter to avoid reading the entire file. I'm not currently at work though (and probably won't be today for holiday reasons he he he), so I can't remember what I set... but if I set the number of lines to be read to 5, I swear\r\n I'm gonna jump off a bridge ;). I'll keep you posted as soon as I get back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) I haven't tried to open and save the workbook to see if the problem persisted.</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, that's about all I can say right now, considering I don't have my source code at home. Still, there's a chance I might get into work today. If I do, you can be certain that the first thing I'll check is that damn filter on the number of lines I'm\r\n actually reading! I swear, the more I think about it, the more I think that's where the problem lies.</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, Joyeux Noel mister francophone ;).</p>\r\n<p>Osu</p>\r\n",
