After clicking \"OK\" I see no problems with the file, though.<br /><br />The same behavior is seen in Excel 2003 SP3. Before upgrading Microsoft Office 2003 with service pack 3 there was no such problem.<br /><br />Others seem to have similar problems with other packages (perhaps similar code)<br /><a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/spreadsheet-writeexcel/browse_thread/thread/6656856820b6f799/\" class=\"externalLink\">http://groups.google.com/group/spreadsheet-writeexcel/browse_thread/thread/6656856820b6f799/<span class=\"externalLinkIcon\" style=\"font-family:Consolas, Courier New, Courier, Monospace;\"></span></a><br /><br />From what I read, the problem is that Excel 2007 is no longer compatible with Excel 95 spreadsheets, but only with Excel 97 spreadsheets and up. Same is the case for  Excel 2003 with SP3.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this makes PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 much less useful.<br /><br />Is there a workaround to this problem? I wouldn't mind sacrificing Excel 95 support.<br />",
