    "Html": "Hello,\r<br />\n<br />\nI need to write a large XLS spreadsheet, but I have no need to actually hold rows I already wrote in memory. The spreadsheet is extremely basic (no styling requirements) but I do use a custom cell handler to write some cells out as text. The spreadsheet is something around 40x10000 with probably 40-60% blank cells. I can write it out in around 45 seconds but it does require me to raise the memory limit beyond 128M.  I am outputting the spreadsheet as an attachment in the browser. The spreadsheet winds up being around 4MB. There are no formulas or calculations.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs it possibly to simply &quot;write out&quot; as I go? \r<br />\n<br />\nHow can I decrease the time it takes to write?\r<br />\n<br />\nI would basically like to &quot;write and forget&quot;, if that makes any sense.<br />\n",
