This module features import/export from Excel/OOCalc\r\n and other formats, and while I was using Java libraries to perform these conversions (Apache POI and ODFDOM respectively), I am now switching to using PHPExcel exclusively. I want to thank the maintainers of PHPExcel for the excellent job they're doing. Having\r\n a unified API for these different formats is a blessing, in addition to the fact that the PHPExcel API is significantly easier to use (and better designed IMO) than the Java counterparts.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Karim</p>\r\n<p>http://drupal.org/user/48424</p>\r\n",

It looks great and its functionality is something a lot of enterprise Drupal user will very much appreciate. Is there a demo site somexwhere where I can play a little and make\r\n some screenshots? Would be a good one to blog about...</p>\r\n<p>With that, I'd like to thank all PHPExcel contributors from my side as well, they are doing a great jb in making PHPExcel a library that is hard to ignore for a lot of PHP projects. What started as as simple &quot;Hello World&quot; blog post has grown into a professional\r\n API that is used widely. Thanks guys!</p>\r\n<p>Best regards,<br>\r\nMaarten</p>\r\n",
