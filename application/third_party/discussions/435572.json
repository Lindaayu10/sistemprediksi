But the input sheet has some cells with conditional formatting that I wish to remove before manipulating and sending back to the user.<br />\n<br />\nThe following is my current code to try to accomplish this task, but it does not remove the conditional formatting:<br />\n<pre><code>$condition_style = new PHPExcel_Style_Conditional();\n$condition_style-&gt;setConditionType(PHPExcel_Style_Conditional::CONDITION_NONE);\n$condition_style-&gt;setOperatorType(PHPExcel_Style_Conditional::OPERATOR_NONE);\n$condition_style-&gt;addCondition('');\n\nfor ($x=1; $x&lt;=$totalrows; $x++) {\n    for ($y=0; $y &lt; $totalcols; $y++) {\n         $worksheet1-&gt;getStyleByColumnAndRow($y,$x)-&gt;setConditionalStyles($condition_style);\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\nAny help and suggestions would be appreciated.<br />\n<br />\nJohn<br />\n",
