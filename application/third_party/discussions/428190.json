a composer file is now maintained on github, and the library was added to packagist.org</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plans for the coming year are to get a release out every three or four months.<br>\r\nNot listed in any particular order as regards releases, here's an overview of the work that I'm planning on doing with the library over the coming year:</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<strong>Major Development Objectives</strong></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>Readers&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Convert XML-based Readers (Excel2007, OOCalc, Gnumeric, Excel2003XML) to use XMLReader rather than SimpleXML, should help performance and reduce memory overheads.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p><strong>Writers&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Additional Writers for Gnumeric, SYLK, OOCalc and Excel2003XML. </li></ul>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Internals&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Convert the Calculation Engine from using Singleton to use Multiton pattern, to prevent cache errors when working with calculations in multiple workbooks.\r\n</li><li>Full support for Array functions in the calculation engine. </li><li>Support for Row and Column references in the calculation engine. </li><li>Performance Rewrite of the Calculation Engine.&nbsp;<br>\r\nThis is a major part of the planned work for the coming year, and development has already started\r\n</li><li>More consistency in method arguments for cell, row, column and range, particularly for styling.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>New Features&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pivot Tables, initially for the Excel2007 Reader/Writer.&nbsp; </li><li>Extend Chart support to Excel5, and to other Readers/Writers. </li></ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>Minor Development Objectives</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><strong>Readers&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ul style=\"padding-left:30px\">\r\n<li>Optional use of PCLZip for Zip-based Readers (Excel2007) for those who can't use ZipArchive.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><strong>Helper Features&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>HTML to Rich-Text Object helper method. </li><li>Additional languages (e.g. Greek, Japanese) and locale features (e.g. date masks such as J instead of Y for Years) for formulae. It's also probable that I'll make each &quot;language pack&quot; an additional download, rather than part of the core download.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><strong>General Objectives</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<div style=\"padding-left:30px\">Ensure no compatability problems running PHPExcel with PHP 5.5.</div>\r\n</li><li>\r\n<div style=\"padding-left:30px\">Ongoing bugfixing.</div>\r\n</li><li>\r\n<div style=\"padding-left:30px\">Ongoing performance testing and (hopefully) improvements.</div>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><strong>Enhanced Documentation</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<div style=\"padding-left:30px\">Online Documentation (including API).</div>\r\n</li><li>\r\n<div style=\"padding-left:30px\">Wiki on github</div>\r\n</li><li>\r\n<div style=\"padding-left:30px\">Links from API Documentation to the Sample code in the /Documentation/Examples and References to Sections in User Documentation.</div>\r\n</li><li>\r\n<div style=\"padding-left:30px\">User reference guides for working with cell data, styling and writing (similar to the reading guide, and with lots of example code).</div>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p><strong>General</strong></p>\r\n<p>PHP 5.2 has been unsupported since 23rd August 2011, and with PHP 5.5 now in alpha, PHP 5.3.0 will be set as the minimum version requirement for PHPExcel before the end of this year. This allows the use of features introduced in PHP 5.3 such as Closures\r\n that can give both memory and performance improvements. Good use of Namespaces would also simplify the process of mocking for unit testing.</p>\r\n",
