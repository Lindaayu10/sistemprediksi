I get the same error message.<br /><br />I've been looking into it, and it seems to be a problem with the script (/Excel5/Workbook.php and OLE_file.php) assuming that I have permissions to write in files created in /tmp - my webhost doesn't agree in this assumption. Yes; I'm using shared hosting :(<br /><br />In Workbook.php on line 574 the init() handle is called on an instance of PHPExcel<i>Writer</i>Excel5<i>OLE</i>PPS<i>File (OLE</i>file.php) which raises the exception 'Can't create temporary file'. As $this-&gt;<i>tmp</i>dir is set to '' in the constructor, tempnam creates the file in /var/tmp (which is the default tmp dir on my host). The file is actually created, but fopen() fails and the exception is thrown. My webhost claims that this is the normal behavior - i.e. php (and not me) owns files created by php.<br /><br />I know that there is an easy (but not exactly portable) fix for this (setting up a dir outside my webscope and hardcode it in the files mentioned above), but maybe a better solution could be found? Furthermore I not convinced, that my webhost is right, but I'm not that much into file permissions and ownership ;)<br /><br />Any suggestions?<br />",

'r')).<br /><br />Warning: fopen() <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Wiki/View.aspx?title=function.fopen\">function.fopen</a>: SAFE MODE Restriction in effect.

The docs does states, that if the first argument i empty or not a valid directory it will default to the system tmp dir.
