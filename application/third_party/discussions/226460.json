So I installed 1.7.4.</p>\r\n<p>And now when I want to output a multi-sheet workbook to html, the HTML writer generates a &quot;&lt;ul class='navigation'&gt;&quot; section at the top of the html body. This is an interesting feature. But actually I would like to get rid of this section. Is there a clean way to do that? (other than commenting the call to generateNavigation() in the save() method of the html writer!)</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
