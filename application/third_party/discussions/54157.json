I need to join these two on a column and create a new excel file.<br>\r\nI do not want the user to do this manually, I like to create a procedure for this. <br>\r\nThe only way I can achieve this is to use PHPExcel, read the two excels match and spit out the result. this should be easy.<br>\r\nBut it feels rather awkward, like jumping over the creek to fetch water. <br>\r\nAny suggestion how to simplify my solution is highly appreciated. <br>\r\n",

Let's say your Sheet2 holds data in the range A1:C90. Then, in Sheet1, insert formulas looking like this:<br>\r\n<code>\r\n<br>\r\n=VLOOKUP(A1, 'Sheet2'!A1:C90, 3, FALSE)&nbsp; // insert this formula in 'Sheet1'!D1<br>\r\n=VLOOKUP(A2, 'Sheet2'!A1:C90, 3, FALSE)&nbsp; // insert this formula in 'Sheet1'!D2<br>\r\n</code>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Replace the formulas in Sheet1 column D with calculated values:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<code>\r\n$cell-&gt;setValue($cell-&gt;getCalculatedValue())<br>\r\n</code>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Save the workbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
