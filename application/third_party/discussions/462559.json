It is an &quot;exact code&quot;, so clearly you're doing something different.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf that doesn't give you a download (open/save) prompt from your web browser, then please explain what it does do,<br />\n",

    "Html": "These files are in the Examples directory in the archive of PHPExcel (answer me that you can't found them  have been better to write that they were not sufficient, no?).\r<br />\n<br />\nIf you want to upload Excel files, you stand in the same way as for any type of file: you created an appropriate form, a small script that will put the file where you want. You can see an example, the explanations on the PHP site (<a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.post-method.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.post-method.php</a>)\r<br />\n<br />\nTo submit your file for download, this can be simplified in two cases: either the Web server can directly serve the file. A simple link is ok (<a href=\"http://example.com/myfile.xls\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://example.com/myfile.xls</a>), or the Web server cannot serve the file, it must be a script that takes it and &quot;pushes&quot; to the client's browser, you will find an example in the documentation for php <a href=\"http://us1.php.net/manual/en/function.readfile.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://us1.php.net/manual/en/function.readfile.php</a>\r<br />\nIn which you will need to change the Content-type header in application/vnd.ms-excel for a xls file or application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet for a xlsx file\r<br />\n<br />\nNone of these operations requires PHPExcel. It will intervene only if you must retrieve data from the file uploaded or if you need to modify or build on the fly file available in download.<br />\n",
