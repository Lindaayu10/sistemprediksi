However, for the life of me, I can't integrate the generation and filesave into a web page. When the user clicks on\r\n a menu link in another page, I want to give them a page saying &quot;Thanks, your report is being built&quot; or similar, then ideally another when finished, plus the regular File Open/Save bar with the report.&nbsp; Is it not possible to achieve this with PHPExcel?</p>\r\n",
