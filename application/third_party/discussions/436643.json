    "Html": "I'm creating a PHP application which generates a Word document in which some excel spreadsheets are embedded.\r<br />\n<br />\nPHPWord is unable to embed xslx objects, so I have tried the .xls output of PHPExcel (PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5).\r<br />\n<br />\nPHPWord generates a Word file with the PHPExcel excel file embedded. But it is not possible to open the embedded Excel file. A 'Convert File' window opens with the text 'Convert file from:' and then there is a dropdown menu with various choices (Plain Text, Encoded Text, Rich Text Format and so on).\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever if I save an Excel file in xls format (Excel 97-2003) and use PHPWord to generate a Word document embedding this excel file, I can later open the embedded excel.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo the xls format PHPExcel generates must be different from the one MS Excel generates.\r<br />\n<br />\nDo you have any suggestion about how to solve this problem?<br />\n",
