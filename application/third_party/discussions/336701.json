After a lot of messing around trying the various readers (Excel5, Excel2003XML, Excel2007), I decided to\r\n have a poke around in the file directly and discovered that it is in fact just a plain text file containing HTML, which happens to have been saved with a '.xls' extension. Excel seems to handle these without too many problems (though it throws up an error\r\n dialogue when I open the file it will still display the spreadsheet), but PHPExcel fails on the canRead() function.</p>\r\n<p>Whilst I could in theory parse the HTML, I'd prefer not to as I already have code written to use PHPExcel. Is there a programmatic way to convert the HTML to Excel? Ideally in PHP but anything which doesn't involve having a Windows machine with Excel would\r\n suffice.</p>\r\n",
