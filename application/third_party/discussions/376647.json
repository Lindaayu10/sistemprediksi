As an example, here is an iteration I have done that populates a part my excel sheet, where the\r\n bold is the part I am having trouble with:</p>\r\n<p>while ($row=mysqli_fetch_array($result)) {<br>\r\n<span style=\"white-space:pre\">&nbsp;</span>$acell='A'.strval($c&#43;4);<br>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $bcell='B'.strval($c&#43;4);<br>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ccell='C'.strval($c&#43;4);<br>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $dcell='D'.strval($c&#43;4);<br>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $ecell='E'.strval($c&#43;4);<br>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValue($acell,'=$B$1');<br>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValue($bcell,$row['task_name']); &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"white-space:pre\">\r\n</span><span style=\"white-space:pre\">&nbsp;</span>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValue($ccell,$row['project_name']);<br>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValue($dcell,$row['HOURS']);<br>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValue($ecell,'=IF(IFERROR('.$dcell.'*$H$3,0),'.$dcell.'*$H$3,0)');</strong><br>\r\n$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getCell($ecell)-&gt;getCalculatedValue();<br>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;$c&#43;=1;<br>\r\n}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now columns A-D work perfectly fine, but the formula in column E, the one that is bolded, does not show up when I generate the excel sheet. When I first open the excel sheet the formula works, as I have the sum of column E at the bottom of the sheet and\r\n I can see the formula works perfectly fine, but there ARE NO VALUES in the column...they're phantom values or something because the sum is adding them, but I can not see them nor the formula in the cells. The cells are completely empty. Then once I hit the\r\n &quot;Enable Edit&quot; button on the excel sheet, the sum goes away and turns to 0.</p>\r\n<p>I have no idea what is happening, please somebody help me figure out the tale of the Phantom Formula! =(</p>\r\n",
