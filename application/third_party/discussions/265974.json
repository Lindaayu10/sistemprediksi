    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>I'm using PHPExcel with Drupal, and our Drupal process is using something called Drush Make.&nbsp; Drush Make defines the codebase--the Drupal core version, the contrib modules needed, and any libraries.&nbsp; Instaed of keeping all this stuff in the repo,\r\n it's just the Drush Make file that defines all this stuff that's kept in the repo.&nbsp; What this means is that a short Drush Make text file is enough to build a full site's codebase.</p>\r\n<p>In order to use this though, Drush Make needs accessible links to all the code.&nbsp; It can handle git authentication but it needs the direct download link.</p>\r\n<p>The issue that I'm running into now is that PHPExcel doesn't have a direct download link.&nbsp; The link launches a &quot;Do you agree tot he license?&quot; popup.&nbsp; I'm not really sure why it's set up this way.&nbsp; Since the code is being distributed with the\r\n license isn't that already enough?</p>\r\n<p>Any chance you can make a direct download link?&nbsp; Otherwise to use this with Drush Make I'll just download the library, unzip it, tar and gzip it, and put it online somewhere.&nbsp; I know I'm able to do this with the Lesser GPL but I'd much rather link\r\n to the download here.</p>\r\n",
