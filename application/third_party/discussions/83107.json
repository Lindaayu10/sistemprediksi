I am having couple of issues as follows:</p>\r\n<p>(1) Excel file generated are in office 2007 format (.xlsx extension). How can I create office 2003 file (with .xls) extension.<br><br>(2) Every time i try to open generated excel file I get message that &quot;windows cannot find c:\\wamp\\wwww\\cs_admin\\read_english_xml.xlsx. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. To search for a file, click the start button, and then click search.&quot;, but interestingly windows open the same file from Temp directory in &quot;Read-only&quot; format. How can fix this issue?</p>\r\n<p>(3) How can i write chinese, japanese and few other languages data in to Excel file. Seems that I have missed something here.</p>\r\n<p>To provide more idea I am using windows XP and wamp 2.0 server. Php version is 5.2.9-2 with php_zip extension enabled. <br><br>This is kind of urgent so please reply asap.<br><br>Any help is much appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Kalpan</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Take a look at 14excel5.php in the /Tests directory<br>Note that certain features of Excel aren't yet available in the Excel5 writer (e.g. use of functions from the analysis toolkpack in your formulae)</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"border:solid .1em #ccc;font-style:italic;margin:.25em 1em 0 1em;padding:0 .25em 0 .25em\"><strong>kalpan_vyas wrote:</strong><br>\r\n<p>(2) Every time i try to open generated excel file I get message that &quot;windows cannot find c:\\wamp\\wwww\\cs_admin\\read_english_xml.xlsx.

Do you have any links to external files? or similar? that might be using relative path names?</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"border:solid .1em #ccc;font-style:italic;margin:.25em 1em 0 1em;padding:0 .25em 0 .25em\"><strong>kalpan_vyas wrote:</strong><br>\r\n<p>(3) How can i write chinese, japanese and few other languages data in to Excel file.
