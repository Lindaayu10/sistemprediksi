This code works well at the localhost server but at the combat host it doesn't work. As I found out the reason is in this one line of code:<br />\n<pre><code>$writer = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($excel, 'Excel2007');</code></pre>\n\nIf I change 'Excel2007' with 'Excel5' everything works. Some men tells that the reason is in the host settings. I'm using the selfmanaged VPS. <br />\n<br />\nPlease help me to understand the reason why do the excel 2007 document cann't be created at the combat host.<br />\n",
