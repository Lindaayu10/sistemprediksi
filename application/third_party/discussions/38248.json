When I read it in, fill in the required values, and save it out, the code and this button have gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs there any way to keep the VB code and button in the output file, either by copying it across, or by inserting the values &quot;directly&quot; into the binary of the original template, perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany thanks, and keep up the good work.<br>\r\nGraham.<br>\r\n",

    "Html": "I see what you mean. I recall there was a somewhat similar question by tepperware who needed textboxes to survive a read/write. He did some tricks and was apparently able to achieve that. This was for Excel 2007.<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=6516\">http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=6516</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour question arises because you are using PHPExcel to generate Excel file from template. That this kind of use would start spreading may or may not have come as a surprise. I don't know. Anyhow, PHPExcel is not optimized for this kind of use. Ideally, a plain read/write should take 0 seconds when no manipulation is done, but this is not the case because all data is always parsed twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a macro sheet that needs to survive a plain read/write. I am not sure whether it is as simple as just injecting a binary macro sheet. I have not seen anyone doing this, but maybe we should give it a try. If you upload or send me the xls file you are working with, then I may try to do some experiments and report back whether there is success or not.\r\n",
