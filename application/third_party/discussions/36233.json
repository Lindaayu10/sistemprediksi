    "Html": "Howdy,<br>\r\n&nbsp; I am a new PHPExcel user attempting to write out excel files.&nbsp; There seems to be some inconsistency with the output.&nbsp; I started with <strong>Excel5</strong> as my format and found that error free files were produced about half of the time.&nbsp; Re-running the script a time or two would eventually create a good file.&nbsp; These results were typical on Ubuntu/OO2.4, XP/Office2007, and Mac/Office2008.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI next tried the <strong>CSV</strong> writer, but encountered a corrupt line that would produce invalid data after a certain line number.&nbsp; Lastly I used the <strong>Excel2007</strong> format which XP/Office2007 complains is corrupt, but works on Mac/Office2008.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneration On:<br>\r\nRedhat 5 (RHEL5)<br>\r\nPHP 5.2.6 with<br>\r\n-xml<br>\r\n&nbsp; libxml2 Version =&gt; 2.6.16<br>\r\n-zip (PECL)<br>\r\n&nbsp; Zip version =&gt; 1.8.10<br>\r\n&nbsp; Libzip version =&gt; 0.7.1<br>\r\n-gd<br>\r\n&nbsp; GD Version =&gt; bundled (2.0.34 compatible)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTesting Files On:<br>\r\n-Ubuntu 8.04 (Open Office 2.4)<br>\r\n-Windows XP (MS Office 2007)<br>\r\n-Mac (MS Office 2008)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I do know is that my content may be a culprit.&nbsp; Would whitespace chars cause CSV or Excel5 to generate corrupt files?&nbsp; The CSV output would go to a certain line and be jumbled/corrupt after that.&nbsp; I can only assume that the Excel5 output would be wholly invalid after a simiar error.&nbsp; Should I be stripping all chars below ASCII 32?&nbsp; What about international charsets?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you for your help, I'm kind of stuck as to how to proceed troubleshooting from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
