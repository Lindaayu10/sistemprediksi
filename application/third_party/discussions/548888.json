    "Html": "Hi, I must be doing something wrong with the install. The download from github has all lower case filenames but the paths in the classes are all camel cased, so even when I modify the examples to find phpexcel.php none of the classes actually load as they are all lower case filenames as well. Surely I don't have to modify the source code to make everything run?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\n<br />\nAndy<br />\n",
