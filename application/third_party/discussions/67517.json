Basically what I do is read in a spreadsheet, append some values from the db, then spit out the sheet again.</p>\r\n<p>I am running WAMP server 2.0 for Vista 64 bit and the newest release of PEAR PHPExcel. The errors that appear everytime after the initial and successful run are:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Warning</strong>:  Attempt to assign property of non-object in <strong>C:\\wamp\\www\\trunk\\PEAR\\PHPExcel\\Reader\\Excel2007.php</strong> on line <strong>200</strong><br> <br> <strong>Warning</strong>:  Attempt to assign property of non-object in <strong>C:\\wamp\\www\\trunk\\PEAR\\PHPExcel\\Reader\\Excel5.php</strong> on line <strong>479</strong><br> <br> <strong>Warning</strong>:  Attempt to assign property of non-object in <strong>C:\\wamp\\www\\trunk\\PEAR\\PHPExcel\\Reader\\Excel5.php</strong> on line <strong>497</strong><br> <br> <strong>Fatal error</strong>:  Call to a member function read() on a non-object in <strong>C:\\wamp\\www\\trunk\\PEAR\\PHPExcel\\Reader\\Excel5.php</strong> on line <strong>500.</strong></p>\r\n<p>The local webserver has to be restarted every time I want to re-run the report for it to work. I wanted to see if this was a server issue so I tried running this in our production server running Gentoo, and received this error:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fatal error</strong>:  Class 'ZipArchive' not found in <strong>/var/www/localhost/htdocs/PEAR/PHPExcel/Reader/Excel2007.php</strong> on line <strong>217</strong></p>\r\n<p>At the moment I am recompiling php with zip enabled for the linux server which I think should fix the production issue. The development server is running without the zip extension enabled, but it still completed successfully so I do not know what the problem is. I hope somebody can help me with this.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Jeramie.</p>",
