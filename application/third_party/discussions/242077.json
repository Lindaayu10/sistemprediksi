The Excel Spreadsheet does contain a few errors, such as 'Invalid Cell Reference Errors', and 'Divide By Zero Error'. Can that be why it's having trouble resaving the file? If you would like the Excel Spreadsheet that I am using, PM me, or Reply stating.</pre>\r\n<pre>Also, while loading the file, it takes around 30s to load it. Can it be because of the 92.5 MB peak memory usage or how large the file is (567KB)? </pre>\r\n<pre>Thank you very much, I hope my questions may be answered.<br></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n",

However, all you're doing is reading and then rewriting a workbook &quot;as is&quot;, so there isn't much you can do to improve the speed of\r\n execution. However, if you know what filetype it is, then use:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;Excel2007&quot;</span>);\r\n$objPHPExcel = $objReader-&gt;load(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;ks.xlsx&quot;</span>);\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>rather than</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>$objPHPExcel = PHPExcel_IOFactory::load(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;ks.xlsx&quot;</span>);\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>because then PHPExcel doesn't have to identify the filetype itself.</p>\r\n<p>It won't make much difference though.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

However, &nbsp;I have tried to cut the Excel sheet down, to 2 Worksheets, (Usually 34 Worksheets), and the xlsx file was created, but didn't finish creating the file and halted. I opened up\r\n the xlsx spreadsheet and a 'Excel found unreadable content'..., and did not recover anything.</p>\r\n<p>3) On the screen, I get an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error, most of the time. Or it loads the page, but it&nbsp;halts during the Save line. No error messages telling me what the problem is, no xlsx file created during these times.</p>\r\n<p>4) There are about&nbsp;&nbsp;(77Rx33C = ) 2,849 Cells for each of the&nbsp;31 of the worksheets, the other 3 are information that the Excel spreadsheet gets its resources from.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your quick reply.</p>\r\n",
