    "Html": "<p>PHPExcel doesn't edit workbook files: it (optionally) maps data from various formats into a PHPExcel object, allows retrieval/manipulation of that object, and provides writers that map the structure of that PHPExcel object into different file formats.</p>\r\n<p>The PHPExcel object neither knows nor cares how it was created and populated, whether by loading from file via a Reader object, or via instantiating a new PHPExcel() and manually setting the cell values. When reading from file, the reader is simply instantiating a PHPExcel object, and calling exactly the same methods to populate that data as you would if you were creating from new. Any information read from a file that can be mapped&nbsp;to the attributes of the PHPExcel object is stored, and then the file is forgotten.</p>\r\n<p>Likewise, the Writer object is unaware whether the PHPExcel object that it is asked to write has been read from a file, or created by hand. It isn't a case of editing, simply of creating an object (perhaps by reading or instantiation in user code) and then saving that object as a file formatted according to a particular standard. Only attributes stored in the PHPExcel object can be written, because that is the only data accessible to the writer.</p>\r\n<p>To restructure the code in such a way that a file could be edited &quot;in situ&quot; would be a significant undertaking, and that's the only way that I can envisage maintaining everything from the structure of a loaded file (other than gradually adding support for those features against the PHPExcel object); especially awkward as we'd have to provide layers allowing all the different supported file formats to be edited &quot;in situ&quot;, while keeping it transparent to you as a developer so that the appropriate methods such as setFormat() mapped onto whichever. It would also reduce the flexibility of PHPExcel to read data from files of one format, and write to another, without significant changes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As light entertainment, I'm currently re-reading the published specifications for xls and xlsx, particularly with regard to charting and pivot tables; but I'm also paying particular attention to functions from the Analysis Toolkit in xls files, and Array formulae. The next release (1.7.4 - primarily bugfixes) is due sometime next week (delayed from the beginning of the month while I sorted out problems with cloning worksheets while using cell cacheing, and some issues with column and row ranges in formulae). Once that's available, my main focus will be adding the charting (and possibly pivot table) features for 1.7.5 (initial target date will be the end of October); and then (hopefully) Analysis Toolkit functions in xls (if I can fathom how they're stored), Array Formulae, and some additional statistical and financial functions in the calculation engine will be targetted for the 1.7.6 release (initial target date will be December).</p>",

The problem arises with the tRef3d references (references to cells in a different sheet). The Excel5 Writer is writing these with a&nbsp;token of 0x7A; but the Excel5 Reader only registers tokens 0x3A and 0x5A for tRef3d. 0x3A, 0x5A and 0x7A are synonymous, they all work the same way, which is why the written file would open correctly in Excel; but the PHPExcel Excel5 reader wasn't recognising 0x7A and falling back to its default behaviour of setting the cell to the previously calculated value rather than the formula that it couldn't correctly parse. I've modified the reader, and double checked all the other tokens that have such synonyms (adding &nbsp;a number of other synonyms for 0x20 (tNum), 0x63 (tName), 0x66 (tMemArea), 0x27 and 0x67 (tMemErr), 0x69 (tMemFunc) and 0x7B (tArea3d). This fix has been checked into SVN, and will be included as a part of (Thursday's) 1.7.4 release.</p>\r\n<p>I'm still investigating the issues with colour.</p>",
