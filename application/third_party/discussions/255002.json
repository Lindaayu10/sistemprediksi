I've heard rumours that Mac only uses palette colours, but never been able to find any definitive confirmation... especially as Mac 2008 has the same colour selection options (theme, standard colours, more colours) as Excel for Windows. If you have a copy of Excel for Windows available, can you try opening in that and see how the colours look there.</p>",

What solution do you suggest?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><br />It wasn't a known problem: just that I'd heard a few rumours from the Office for Mac forums, without every hearing anything to verify that this is the case (and I'm not a Mac user myself).</p>\r\n<p>I don't have a clean solution: as I said previously, PHPExcel doesn't use themes when writing (and I know that they're a PITA to read) but sets each cell colours directly as RGB values. Changing that to work with themes isn't a trivial task to start; and could easily result in variations in the shading of colours because it's all based on a percentage intensity of the actual theme colour.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If it was designed to allow any RGB colour as at present, and then map those RGBs to theme colours and intensities; then it could be a performance drain for the writer... so I'd want to make it a feature that needed to be explicitly enabled as a variation on the current default behaviour.</li>\r\n<li>The alternative is writing colour setting logic that only permits colours/intensities from a predefined theme. This would entail changing the PHPExcel_Style_Color (or providing a PHPExcel_Style_ThemeColor class), and themes (and a theme&nbsp;class, with Reader/user options to set/update that class).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Neither of these options is easy to implement, though I do already have a PHPExcel_Reader_Excel2007_Theme class that serves as a theme colour map for the Excel2007 Reader, working with some static methods in the PHPExcel_Style_Color class to adjust brightness/intensity... and these could provide a starting point for either solution.</p>",

    "Html": "<p>revdev: I don't know if it helps for your situation or not, but you can alter the default palette manually by editing 'PHPExcel/Style/Color.php'. The colors are defined starting on line 371. PHPExcel 1.7.6.</p>\n<p>This would change the palette for any spreadsheet created with your edited version of PHPExcel. However, since it edits the palette, instead of the color assigned to each cell, it should achieve what you're after (you would of course still need to style the cell appropriately). I do not know if there is any special caveat  working with a Mac however. This is what I had to do for my project (which must output an Excel 2005 file) and it worked wonderfully. It might be another thing for you to try.</p>\n<p>It sounds like Mark has a better solution rattling around in his head (and maybe a future release), so this would definitely be a quick and dirty/duct tape method by comparison.</p>",
