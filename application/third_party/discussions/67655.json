Now of course at present I will look in an exampe for somewhere this has been done and copy the code, however it would be great if there was an easy reference that I coudl use.</p>\r\n<p>The question might be stupid as I'm sure there is a good reason why I have not found one, but lookin in the docs at the Appendix I was looking at the entries and I could see &quot;GetColour&quot; but I was expecting a SetColour.</p>\r\n<p>On searching through the rest of the doc I found an example which shows</p>\r\n<p>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getStyle('B2')-&gt;getFont()-&gt;getColor()-&gt;setARGB(PHPExcel_Style_Color::COLOR_RED);</p>\r\n<p>So I assume I need to get the colo9ur object and then set it using &quot;setARGB&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>But there was no where I could look up this info or look up SetARGB and find out more about the function (at least I cannot find it).</p>\r\n<p>I'm probably quite old school (pre - OO approach to coding) but I'm learning bit by bit.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
