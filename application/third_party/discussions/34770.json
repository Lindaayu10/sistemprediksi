    "Html": "When one reads a spreadsheet using Excel2007 reader together with the <code>setReadDataOnly(true)</code> option one finds that Rich-Text cell values are not converted to plain text. This may be a bit surprising since all other cell formatting (fonts, colors etc.) is removed during the load process. Besides being surprising I think it may be impractical too and I am therefore asking whether or not it would be better to return plain text whenever one uses <code>setReadDataOnly(true)</code>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExample:<br>\r\nConsider that one wants to use PHPExcel to process orders submitted via Excel 2007 spreadsheets. In such situations I think one would rarely be interested in more than plain text. Still it may be hard to prevent the customer from inserting Rich-Text because this may happen accidentally when copying from other applications such as Microsoft Office Word. To process a spreadsheet that may or may not contain Rich-Text one would have to use multiple constructions like this to get the plain text:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<code>\r\n$value = $cell-&gt;getValue();<br>\r\n<br>\r\n// get plain text<br>\r\n$plainText = ($value instanceof PHPExcel_RichText) ?<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;$value-&gt;getPlainText() : $value;<br>\r\n</code>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should be the effect of <code>setReadDataOnly(true)</code> for cell values? A guideline could be this: It gives what you see in the Microsoft Office Excel formula bar after selecting number format &quot;General&quot;.\r\n",
