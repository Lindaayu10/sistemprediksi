However I came up with a question on the issue of removal of rows and columns.</p>\r\n<p>In Excel (program), I can only delete the selected rows in the same way with the columns. (For example: A1: A10 - In Excel, the content would be moved up, but not to the rest could shake. So does the column, however the column is shifted to the left).</p>\r\n<p>I wonder if you can do this also with PHPExcel therefore need to delete some rows from column B through F can not put content on the move starting in column G.</p>\r\n<p>Did I make myself clear? Already thanks!</p>\r\n",
