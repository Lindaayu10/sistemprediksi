Cause I'm lazy I'm trying to go around parsing my (x)html for further RichText -&gt;getFont()-&gt;setBold() conversion. Instead of I thought to use some kind of html2RTF converter/parser and put that &quot;raw&quot; RTF via some kind of -&gt;setValue($rawRTF) into the Sheet. Is it possible ?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance for your help !</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
