This allows the script to run on many files without using Terabytes of memory :)</p>\r\n<p>my problem is if INSIDE a single file i've ENORMOUS worksheet. In this case, as you can understand, disconnecting worksheets at the end of parsing is a nonsense, but as far as i know there is not a way to disconnect a SINGLE worksheet while parsing a file</p>\r\n<p>am i wrong?</p>\r\n<p>thanks</p>\r\n<p>bye</p>\r\n",
