    "Html": "Sorry, I misread your post. I guess you still need the leading zeros. The above will not work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out that in MS Office Excel 2007 (and probably earlier versions too) whenever you first set number format to be &quot;Text&quot; and then enter a value such as '0200' then MS Office Excel will automatically change data type to 'String' for the cell in order to show the leading zeros. I was not aware of that. PHPExcel does not mimic this special behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo get the same result in PHPExcel, you will have to explicitly set the data type for the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<code>\r\n$ws-&gt;getStyle('A1')-&gt;getNumberFormat()-&gt;setFormatCode('@');<br>\r\n$ws-&gt;getCell('A1')-&gt;setValueExplicit('0200', PHPExcel_Cell_DataType::TYPE_STRING);<br>\r\n</code>\r\n<br>\r\nNote that rendering will be the same in MS Office Excel even if you leave out the format code above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, string data type may not be the right approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsider this solutions too which uses ordinary numerical data type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<code>\r\n$ws-&gt;getCell('B1')-&gt;setValue(200);<br>\r\n$ws-&gt;getStyle('B1')-&gt;getNumberFormat()-&gt;setFormatCode('0000');<br>\r\n$ws-&gt;getStyle('B1')-&gt;getAlignment()-&gt;setHorizontal(PHPExcel_Style_Alignment::HORIZONTAL_LEFT);\r\n</code>\r\n",
