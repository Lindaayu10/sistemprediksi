The User Documentation &ndash; Reading Spreadsheet Files.doc was the first document in an attempt to improve this situation, and I'm writing further user documents on other features (Writing,\r\n Accessing Data, Setting Data, Setting Styles, Calculating, Charts, etc) trying to highlight all the options, with working examples. Unfortunately, the release build process missed the examples --&nbsp;hopefully that problem is fixed for the next production\r\n release -- the examples are available in the SVN repository. It's a slow process, and I'll be working on it all over the next few releases. I'm also setting up a documentation site where I'll be making all these documents available to browse online.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Helper methods for converting between Excel units and pixels are the pixelsToCellDimension() and cellDimensionToPixels() methods of the PHPExcel_Shared_Drawing class.
