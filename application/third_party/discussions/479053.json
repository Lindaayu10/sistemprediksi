This means that if I read 100 rows per time it will take 16 page reloads of my application and 8 minutes time to read a simple 100kb file.\r<br />\n<br />\nI use the develop branch from github and run php 5.5.0 on windows. On my production server I run php 5.4\r<br />\n<br />\nI need to break up my file since in some occasions I will deal with larger files that have 20,000 rows and try to avoid page time outs without setting the timeout to indefinite. \r<br />\n<br />\nMy questions are:\r<br />\nAm I missing something and thus doing something horribly wrong?\r<br />\nCan I speed up the load method beside doing things that I already did, e.g. the setReadFilter and setReadDataOnly?\r<br />\nOr am I using a wrong branch?<br />\n",
