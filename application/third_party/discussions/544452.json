It takes about 2-4 minutes to process a 9MB csv file that has about 100000 rows of data. \r<br />\n<br />\nI have tried it on a server with maximum amount of memory alloted to the php engine and the machine is a hard core one which only means that my code is bad. \r<br />\n<br />\nmy question is, is phpexcel a good choice to extract data which will have millions of rows of data. The machine that i have is very good so no worries in terms of cpu and memory. \r<br />\n<br />\nHope people don't find this silly. <br />\n",

    "Html": "No it isn't a good choice.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf you're working purely with CSV data, then use PHP's built-in <code>fgetcsv()</code> function for reading CSV files, or even MySQL's <code>LOAD DATA INFILE</code> (assuming you're using MySQL, though most databases have an equivalent). This allows you to process a CSV file using a minimal amount of processing and memory overhead.\r<br />\n<br />\nPHPExcel is designed for working with spreadsheet files, with formatted data, and formulae, and other spreadsheet features that you don't find in CSV files; and while it will work with CSV files as well, it has a large overhead in comparison with the built-in PHP function or the database itself.<br />\n",
