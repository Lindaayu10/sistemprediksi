The file should probably have been named <span style=\"font-family:courier new\">FDPF.php</span> in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am saying this because the class name is <span style=\"font-family:courier new\">FPDF</span> (in uppercase) as one sees if one opens the file. Then we will be following the usual naming convention which makes it possible to use this autoload function so one does not explicitly have to include classes when they are needed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new\">function __autoload($class) {<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; require_once str_replace('_', '/', $class) . '.php';<br>\r\n}</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, the FPDF class may be useful not only in connection with PHPExcel. Renaming to <span style=\"font-family:courier new\">FPDF.php</span> makes it readily available via the above autoload function.<br>\r\n",
