However the peak memory is ~900mb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat can happend if i set the memory_limit so high ? i am the only one working against the server on localhost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow come the peak memory is so high, is php leaking so much in these loops ??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nis there any other trick to avoid using so much memory?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI use <br>\r\n<br>\r\nini_set(&quot;memory_limit&quot;,&quot;2048M&quot;);<br>\r\n<br>\r\necho date('H:i:s') . &quot; Load from Excel5 file\\n&quot;;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n$objPHPExcel = new PHPExcel();<br>\r\n$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel5');<br>\r\n$objReader-&gt;setReadDataOnly(TRUE);<br>\r\n$objPHPExcel = $objReader-&gt;load('input.xls');<br>\r\n<br>\r\n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'CSV');<br>\r\n$objWriter-&gt;setDelimiter(';');<br>\r\n$objWriter-&gt;setEnclosure('');<br>\r\n$objWriter-&gt;save('example.csv');<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, in my created csv the character gets strange. Is it UTF-8 as default ?<br>\r\nIt doesn't seems to support Swedish å ä ö<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",

Yes, all strings are UTF-8 in PHPExcel, what character set do you need?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Can you can upload the Excel file somewhere and send me a link? (erik at phpexcel dot net). This will help us tuning the library for large-scale Excel files.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
