I'm also looking at the differences between OOCalc 2 and OOCalc 3 that are causing a few problems for the reader, and wondering if I should split down to an OOCalc2 and an OOCalc3 reader and writer, or simply focus on OOCalc 3... my inclination is the OO3 only.</p>\r\n<p>Don't expect anything for the next release (1.7.3) of PHPExcel, but I hope to have a first draft OOCalc writer for 1.7.4 (expect around May, or earlier if you pick it up in the SVN daily downloads)</p>",
