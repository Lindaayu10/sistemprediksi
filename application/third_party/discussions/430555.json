Therefore I protect the sheet with a password. </span>\r\n</span>So far so good.</p>\r\n<p>But now the users can't insert new lines because all cells are locked by default.</p>\r\n<p>I tried to create a template excel file. In this file I unlocked all cells, load it in my app, fill data - But again, all cells locked!</p>\r\n<p>At the alternate excel framework (PEAR - ExcelSpreadsheetWriter) this problem does not appear, but it can't read and write version 2007.</p>\r\n<p>Now my question: how can I set ALL cells unlocked initially?</p>\r\n<p>Regards Christian</p>\r\n",
