I'm creating an XLSX with a number of different sheets etc. and all works well in that aspect - the problem comes up when I try to lock down certain cells. The idea is that there\r\n is one header row, which I want to keep locked. The rows underneath are editable by the end user.<br>\r\nI have tried several different versions / approaches of this idea, but every time I apply the security to the cells, the entire sheet gets locked top to bottom.<br>\r\nHere is my code (largely taken from the samples found online):</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # LOCKING CELLS<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getProtection()-&gt;setSheet(true);<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getStyle('A1:' . getNameFromNumber($subcounter - 1) . '1')-&gt;getProtection()-&gt;setLocked(PHPExcel_Style_Protection::PROTECTION_PROTECTED);</p>\r\n<p>the &quot;getNameFromNumber&quot; function returns an Excel alphabetical column name based on the number I pass in (easier that way to keep a counter). I'm trying to lock the first row for however many columns there are in the sheet (through whatever the counter-1\r\n is).</p>\r\n<p>Any insight would be MUCH appreciated!</p>\r\n<p>- C</p>\r\n",
