    "Html": "So it seems that CakePHP causes problems when trying to use PHPExcel.  If I run the following function outside of cakePHP it works fine.  The instant i place it in cake, when excel trys to open the file it says &quot;Excel cannot open the file'MyDB.xlsx' because the file format or file extension is not valid.  Verify the file has not been corrupted and that the extension matches the format of the file.&quot;  Now with the one not living inside of cake I'm able to unzip the file and see all the xml files inside.  The one that comes from cake has a corrupt zip file. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy question, does anyone know how to debug that?  I know it's not my php install's fault because the script works outside of cakePHP.  Any feedback would be greatly appreaciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;pre&gt;<br>\r\n<p>                require_once 'PHPExcel.php';</p>\r\n<p>                /** PHPExcel_Cell_AdvancedValueBinder */<br>\r\n                require_once 'PHPExcel/Cell/AdvancedValueBinder.php';</p>\r\n<p>                /** PHPExcel_IOFactory */<br>\r\n                require_once 'PHPExcel/IOFactory.php';</p>\r\n<p>                // Set value binder<br>\r\n                PHPExcel_Cell::setValueBinder( new PHPExcel_Cell_AdvancedValueBinder() );</p>\r\n<p>                // Create new PHPExcel object<br>\r\n                $objPHPExcel = new PHPExcel();<br>\r\n                $objPHPExcel-&gt;getProperties()-&gt;setTitle(&quot;My DB Export&quot;);<br>\r\n                $objPHPExcel-&gt;getProperties()-&gt;setSubject(&quot;My DB Export&quot;);<br>\r\n                $objPHPExcel-&gt;getProperties()-&gt;setKeywords(&quot;My DB office 2007 openxml php&quot;);</p>\r\n<p>                // Add some data<br>\r\n                $objPHPExcel-&gt;setActiveSheetIndex(0);</p>\r\n<p>                $hfer = '&amp;C&amp;HExported from My DB Unclassified/FOUO';<br>\r\n                $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getHeaderFooter()-&gt;setOddHeader($hfer);<br>\r\n                $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getHeaderFooter()-&gt;setOddFooter($hfer);</p>\r\n<p>                $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValue('A1','MaitrePylos');</p>\r\n<p>                // redirect output to client browser</p>\r\n<p>                header('Content-Type: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet');<br>\r\n                header('Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=&quot;MyDB.xlsx&quot;');<br>\r\n                header('Cache-Control: max-age=0');</p>\r\n<p>                $objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel2007');<br>\r\n                $objWriter-&gt;save('php://output');<br>\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;</p>\r\n",

Upon deleting them, the file was OK.</p>\r\n<p>So I started too look in my class file for the spaces but they were nowhere to be found. It was only until I read your last reply that I realised to look after the ?&gt; . It would seem that they were taken as html and included in the xls.</p>\r\n<p>So... thank you again :)</p>",
