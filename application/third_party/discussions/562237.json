    "Html": "At this point, no it isn't.<br />\nExcel flags certain functions such as <code>RAND()</code> as <code>volatile</code> and changes the behaviour of whether or not to recalculate cells in a spreadsheet on load based on that, and the (somewhat limited) documentation suggests that volatile formulae will always be recalculated.<br />\n<br />\nWhen loading files into PHPExcel, PHPExcel will not recalculate any formulae unless you explicitly request <code>getCalculatedValue()</code> or <code>getFormattedValue()</code> for a cell<br />\nIf you want to retrieve the result of a formula calculation without recalculating (e.g. the value that was last calculated in MS Excel itself) in PHPExcel, then <code>getOldCalculatedValue()</code> can be used.<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi MarkBaker,<br />\n<br />\nThank you so much for your detailed answer. <br />\nI did not know the function <code>getOldCalculatedValue</code>, it was really useful to me. <br />\n<br />\nHowever, I know it's possible to configure a workbook so that volatile functions like <code>RAND</code> are not re-calculated when a workbook is opened (by Excel), except if the user explicit requires it. I think this feature is called &quot;mode&quot;, and can have values such as &quot;manual&quot; or &quot;automatic&quot;. <br />\nSo, according to you, it's not possible to leverage this setting with PHPExcel? <br />\n<br />\nThank you again.<br />\n",
