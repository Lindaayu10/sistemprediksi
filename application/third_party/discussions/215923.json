I read some of discussions - it seems that issue has been around for a while. Question is - is there any workaround for this ? If not, is there any chance it can be implemented in the future ? Otherwise, I am sure, that many people will find PDF package useless. \r\n\r\nThanks, anyway, for great product!\r\n\r\nRgs,\r\n Andis",
