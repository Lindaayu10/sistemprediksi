    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm trying to write into a cell a third party formula, i.e., not a native Excel formula. We use Office Connector Excel plug-in to connect to an ERP called Sage. This plug-in enables a new set of formulas, including one called TSIMPORT.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen I write with the library &quot;=TSIMPORT(...)&quot; with all the correct parameters and values, Excel treats it as a string unless I manually click on the cell to edit the content, make no changes and hit Enter. Only then, Excel will consider it a formula. Of course this does not happen if I manually type the formula in Excel. \r<br />\n<br />\nNot sure if there's something that I'm setting wrong or there's another approach.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for your help.<br />\n",
