    "Html": "Hi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm inserting text into Excel cells and I'm having trouble with getting it to appear correctly in the generated Excel file. The problem is that it continues to run beyond the scope of the cell so that it appears to the user as if it has been sliced in the middle. Of course, if you expand the cell this data appears. However, this issue is not solved when printing the file, which my application will automatically do directly after the Excel file has been generated. One solution is to use the capability of PHPExcel to automatically set the column width, but then another problem arises. The sheet becomes to wide to print without scaling the sheet down too much to be readable by people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what I'm looking for is a possibility to make long text expand below the initial text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExample:<br>\r\nInstead of: Hello World!<br>\r\nIt will apperas as if it is:<br>\r\nHello <br>\r\nWorld!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe row height will indeed increase, but that is not an issue. The important thing is that the width remain the same. I tried inserting newlines (\\n) between the words (if that would have worked I could have designed a PHP function to set these newlines in the correct places to create the effect I'm searching for). But it didn't work. So my question is if there is a builtin method someplace within the PHPExcel classes that I can make use for? Or if someone can help me understand how I can create working newlines within Excel. Because \\n doesn't seem to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks in advance.<br>\r\n",
