    "Html": "<p>Hello,</p>\r\n<p>First off, I would like to thank to the developers of such wonderful script, PHPExcel. I've been using it for a while for on the fly Excel editing stuff with PHP. Most of time, I create an excel file with MS Excel GUI and then use it as a template for PHPExcel.</p>\r\n<p>Today, I wanted to use a relatively larger XLS file with a file size of approximately 100 KB. I experienced &quot;out-of-memory&quot; errors as the PHP memory limit was 32 MB. I didn't think of updating PHP memory settings since I wouldn't have priveleges to access php.ini on any servers that I have to deal with. Thus, the right decision appeared to be some attempt to resolve the problem in application side. To this end, I first wanted to look at this web site to see whether some workarounds, suggestions and something related can be found. Consequently, I realized that my PHPExcel was somewhat old and a newer version is available (I guess it was 7.2).</p>\r\n<p>After installing the newest version of PHPExcel from this website, the behaviour of the php script that uses PHPExcel has changed. Previously, the same script that was giving &quot;out-of-memory&quot; errors has started to make Apache crash. I've run into Apache logs and got the following message :</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<pre>[notice] Parent: child process exited with status 3221225725 -- Restarting.</pre>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>After some investigations, I've found out that in the meantime PHPExcel creates some TMP files in the temporary folder. I don't know if it fails while creating these files or upon their creation.</p>\r\n<p>All information I have is above. I guess the main problem is that the xls file is a bit larger than PHPExcel want it to be.</p>\r\n<p>How can I overcome it? And what are your opinions ?</p>\r\n<p>Thank you very much for reading so far.</p>\r\n<p>Mustafa</p>",
