This is something I would like to look at in the future, but first the formula parser for PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 needs to be fixed first. It is unfortunately quite buggy at the moment. This could easily amount to 2 months of full-time work.</p>\r\n<p>Once this is ready, I will start to look at data validation, conditional styling etc. for PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5 and PHPExcel_Reader_Excel5.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
