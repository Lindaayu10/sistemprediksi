Some of the cells have mixed font attributes (eg: this is plain,<em> but this is italic</em>, <strong><em>and this is italic bold)</em></strong>&nbsp;within the one cell. After updating the spreadsheet with data the resulting spreadsheet has lost the mixed richtext and the cell will appear as plain text. I should point out that I am not updating any of the cells that contain the mixed formatting. I am only inserting values into empty cells.</p>\n<p>Is this a bug or is there a way of retaining these settings? I know I could insert the mixed text from PHPExcel and set the richtext formatting at that point, but I was hoping to avoid this if I could.</p>\n<p>Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>",

Am I correct in assuming that Rich Text works ok in the .xlsx workbooks? I've had a look at the work item you included. What are the chances that this might be fixed for .xls formats any time soon? Or will it be fixed at all?</p>\r\n<p>Cheers!</p>",

A part of my next phase of development requires reworking the underling OLE Writer (that forms the basis for the Excel5 Writer) to handle additional streams (such as document properties) and I'm hoping that I'll be able to incorporate a number of the features that aren't currently supported by the Excel5 Writer while I'm working on that. Estimated timescales for that work are mid summer.</p>",
