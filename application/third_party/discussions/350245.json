The file may be read-only, or you may be trying to access a read-only location. Or, the server the document is stored on may not be responding\"</p>\n<p>Details:</p>\n<p>Server creating the file: Centos 4 linux, php 5.2.10, PHPExcel version 1.7.6</p>\n<p>Client setup getting the error: Windows XP, Internet Explorer 8.0, Office 2003</p>\n<p>Interesting observations:</p>\n<p>1. Works fine using firefox (both on linux &amp; xp) opening straight to Excel</p>\n<p>2. Works fine saving in firefox then opening in Excel - does not work when saving file using IE and then opening directly in Excel</p>\n<p>3. Looked at the file permission both on the linux server where an archive is kept and the PC - both are fine and identical to working files</p>\n<p>3. Noticed one posting suggesting Excel service pack needed - so updated Excel 2003 to SP3 - still doesn't work</p>\n<p>4. Not a consistent problem - most files work just fine, still trying to figure out common thread of bad files</p>\n<p>Any thoughts? - php settings such as magic quotes, incorrect handling of slashes/symbols, etc?</p>\n<p>appreciate any help!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
