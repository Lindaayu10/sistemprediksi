When I open the excel sheet, the cell has a value of 40492 (which is the excel value of 2010-11-10) and the format is general. When I change the format to dd-mm-yyyy in excel, the date is displayed correctly.</p>\r\n<p>How do I make my code to change the format of the cell to date? Is there anything wrong with my setFormatCode? I am using this code within my drupal application. Would that be the cause? But all other data is getting written correcly onto the excel sheet.</p>\r\n<p>I am using PHPExcel 1.7.4 and creating a xls document.

I am trying to set the following formula for a cell.</p>\r\n<p>=COUNTIFS(E:E,&quot;Major&quot;,D:D,&quot;Documentation&quot;)</p>\r\n<p>But it gives me an error. When I put the same in the excel sheet, it is accepted properly. Please let me know if PHPExcel is alright with using COUNTIFS for formulas.</p>\r\n<p>Given below is the piece of code (in PHP) that writes the formula to the excel sheet.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $major_formula = '=COUNTIFS(E:E,&quot;Major&quot;,D:D,&quot;Testing&quot;)';&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $objWorksheet-&gt;setCellValue('M1', $major_formula);</p>\r\n<p>Looking forward for your help.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

There are two files in the /Documentation folder -- FunctionListByName.txt and FunctionListByCategory.txt -- that list all of the Excel functions, and whether or not they are currently implemented.</p>\r\n<p>At present, when saving a file using the Excel2007 or Excel5 Writers, PHPExcel saves both the formula and the calculated result... so calculating the result for a formula that contains a function that isn't implemented will result in an error. You can disable\r\n this pre-calculation&nbsp;by setting $objWriter-&gt;setPreCalculateFormulas(false); befor eyou save. When the saved file is then opened in Excel, it may automatically recalcuate all formulae, might prompt the user to recalculate, or (worst case) not let the\r\n user know that a recalculation is necessary and display invalid values in those cells (that's why we try to precalculate when we can).</p>\r\n<p>Other writers, such as CSV, HTML and PDF require formulas to be calculated within PHPExcel so that the correct result can be rendered; so disabling precalculation is not an option.</p>\r\n<p>Note also that the Excel5 Writer doesn't allow formulae containing functions that aren't part of the Excel5 core set, so Analysis Toolkit functions are not supported.</p>\r\n",
