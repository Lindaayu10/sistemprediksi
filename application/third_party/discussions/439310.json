    "Html": "Please provide some example of <strong><em>a messy file, full of chinese characters</em></strong> as it's not particularly descriptive. You shouldn't be seeing chinese characters; but a binary file could easily be construed as <strong>messy</strong>, and an xlsx file <strong>is</strong> a binary file. How are you opening the resulting file to see it is a mess of characters? Does MS Excel throws an error when reading it?<br />\n",

Here go the steps I followed, the messages and the results:\r<br />\n<br />\nBy opening the .xlsx file in Excel 2007 I get the following message:<br />\n<pre><code>&quot;Excel found unreadable content in 'report_file.xlsx'. Want to recover the contents of this workbook? If you trust the source of this workbook, click Yes.&quot;\n</code></pre>\n\nBy clicking 'Yes' I get the next message:<br />\n<pre><code>&quot;The file is corrupt and can not be opened.&quot;\n</code></pre>\n\nAnd then the file is not opened.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo I renamed the resulting file extension to .xls (&quot;report_file.xls&quot;) and tried open in Excel 2007, getting the following message:<br />\n<pre><code>&quot;The file you are trying to open, 'report_file.xls', is in a different format than specified by the file extension. Make sure the file is not corrupted and is from a trusted source before you open it. Want to open the file now?&quot;\n</code></pre>\n\nBy clicking 'Yes' the file is opened and I see what actually isn't chinese chars, like the folowing, copy and pasted:\r<br />\n<br />\non cell A1:\t\t\t\t<br />\n<pre><code>PK\u0003\u0004\u0014\bÕQˆBûtùãc\u0001&quot;\u0005\u0013[Content_Types].xml­”ËNÃ0\u0010E÷|Eä-JÜ²@\b5í‚Â\u0012*Q&gt;ÀØ“Æª_ò¸¯¿g’´¼¤\u0006ªvcËrî=ÎõŒG“­5Ù\u001a&quot;jïJ6,\u0006,\u0003'½ÒnQ²·ùS~Ç2LÂ)a¼ƒ’íÙd|5šï\u0002`Fb‡%«S\n</code></pre>\n\non cell A2<br />\n<pre><code>÷œ£¬Á\n</code></pre>\n\non cell A3<br />\n<pre><code>,|G;•V$ZÆ\u0005\u000fB.Å\u0002øÍ`pË¥w</code></pre>\n\n...\r<br />\non cell A17<br />\n<pre><code>9_ÌÒxú=\u0019r‚¿ï¿ü\u0003PK\u0003\u0004\u0014\bÕQˆB\u0010}I_º\u0001V\u0003\u0011docProps/core.xml¥SËnœ0\u0014Ý÷+,ö`ÈŒª\b1ŽR:©æQÁTíÖ±oˆ\u001b°‘í„ð</code></pre>\n\nand so on.\r<br />\nThat is what actually happens.<br />\n",
