It that allows exports in PDF, CSV, or Excel formats.\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever, the Excel format causes errors (even though it looks identical to the CSV format).\r<br />\n<br />\nExcel says &quot;The file format and extension of &quot;yaddayadda.xls&quot; don't match. The file could be corrupted or unsafe. Unless you trust it's source, don't open it.&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nI think this has to deal with extension hardening:\r<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vsofficedeveloper/archive/2008/03/11/excel-2007-extension-warning.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vsofficedeveloper/archive/2008/03/11/excel-2007-extension-warning.aspx</a>\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAnyway as a big rookie with PHPExcel, what part of the source code does the function that writes .XLS/ Excel documents found, so I can change that to just write CSVs? Help appreciated, thanks.<br />\n",
