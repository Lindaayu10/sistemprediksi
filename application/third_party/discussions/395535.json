I am trying not to specify each column during export.</p>\r\n<p>Then on another server, i would upload the file and updating the tables.</p>\r\n<p>Anyone done this before?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Some ways : DIY,, use select into outfile for the dump(s), load data to import, if you want a GUI, use PHPMyAdmin, look for specialized script; etc.</p>\r\n<p>If you really want a excel file... Well... You can use '*' in your query and mysqli_fetch_fields (or mysqli_result::fetch_fields) to have the fields name.</p>\r\n<p>Using a method or another, the hard thing is to select what to import : truncate the destination table and import all ? Use a unique key with insert ignore / replace ? More complex conditions ?</p>",
