For instance, the cells A2 to H5 must be merged, I2 to L2 must be merge, I3 to J3 and K3 to L3 must be\r\n merged. I need to know which cells are merged with a current cell. Is it possible do this with PHPExcel ? Which methods are available to check this ?</p>\r\n<p>Best regards,</p>\r\n<p>Xavier</p>\r\n",
