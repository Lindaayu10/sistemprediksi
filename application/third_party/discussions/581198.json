They will correct themselves if I update the field with slightly different information (start at B2 instead of B1 for instance) and this is across LibreOffice, Mac Preview, OpenOffice, and Word 2013. The Word 2013 users have gotten around it by re-saving the file from their app and re-opening it, then the formulas display correctly.<br />\n<br />\nSimple example below:<br />\n/<em> A3 will display as 0 instead of 30, and when it does display, it's left aligned, might be a clue </em>/<br />\ninclude 'PHPExcel.php';<br />\ninclude 'PHPExcel/IOFactory.php';<br />\n$EXCEL = new PHPExcel();<br />\n$EXCEL-&gt;setActiveSheetIndex(0);<br />\n$SHEET = $EXCEL-&gt;getActiveSheet();<br />\n$SHEET-&gt;setTitle(&quot;Worksheet&quot;);<br />\n<br />\n$SHEET-&gt;setCellValue('A1', '10');<br />\n$SHEET-&gt;setCellValue('A2', '20');<br />\n$SHEET-&gt;setCellValue('A3', '=(A1+A2)');<br />\n<br />\n//output//<br />\n$WRITER = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($EXCEL, 'Excel2007');<br />\nheader('Content-Type: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet');<br />\nheader('Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=&quot;test.xlsx&quot;');<br />\nheader('Cache-Control: max-age=0');<br />\n$WRITER-&gt;save(&quot;php://output&quot;);<br />\n",
