    "Html": "<p>I tried to run your code and it seemed to work fine with both Excel2007 and Excel5 writer. The cells in row 12 were protected with a password as expected when I opened the output in MS Office Excel 2007.</p>\r\n<p>However, I noticed that in OpenOffice 3.1 the cell protection was not working. So I conclude that OpenOffice 3.1 does not support cell protection. This should not be confused with &quot;locked cells&quot; which is something else and is controlled via the cell style. Adding to the confusion: &quot;Locked cells&quot; in Excel is called &quot;protected cells&quot; in OpenOffice.</p>\r\n<p>When you say that it is not working, which application did you open the Excel file with?</p>",

I didn't try Excel and don't have a working copy on my Windows machine as I work almost exclusively on Ubuntu Linux.</p>\r\n<p>Great news it works with Excel, because that's what the client will be using.</p>\r\n<p>But it sounds like perhaps &quot;locked cells&quot; would suit us better. Basically, all we need is for the client to not be able to modify certain cells, we don't need password protection on them.</p>\r\n<p>What would the syntax look like for locking cells?</p>\r\n<p>Also, is there a regular API type documentation that lists all the class methods instead of just the &quot;recipes file&quot;?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for the quick response and also for a great library! It's easy to use, very robust and just all around great. It was exactly what we needed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
