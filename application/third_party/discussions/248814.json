However, this is not working correctly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is the code:</p>\n<p>$row = 1;</p>\n<p>$total = 0;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $height = $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getRowDimension($row)-&gt;getRowHeight();</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $total += $height;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo \"Height 1 \".$total;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // says 25</p>\n<p>$row++;&nbsp;&nbsp; // (2)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $height = $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getRowDimension($row)-&gt;getRowHeight();</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $total += $height;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echo \"Height 2 \".$total;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // says -1 / 24</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first one shows me a correct \"25\". However, as soon as I increment the row variable, it only does -1 on and on. So the total variable decreases. If I have 25 rows, the last total echo says \"0\" instead of \"625\" or something. Does someone have solution  for this tiny problem? Or is there any other way to check if a new page has to start?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Btw. I got PHPExcel V&nbsp; 1.7.4, WinXP and PHP V 5.3.1</p>",
