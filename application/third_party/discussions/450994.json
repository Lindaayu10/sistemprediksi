I think the best way to do this is (in theory) would be to create an excel template with built-in styles and then then use PHPExcel's HTML writer to add the appropriate classes based on these styles. However, I can't find a way to get the Excel cell style name from PHPExcel - is this something that is possible?\r<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks for any suggestions.<br />\n",
