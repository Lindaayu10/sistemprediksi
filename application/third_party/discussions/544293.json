When I set the cache method, having activated apcu in my ini file, it seems to go through and returns true, however, when I call PHPExcel_Settings::getCacheStorageMethod() immediately after i get a value of 'Memory'. Is PHPExcel silently reverting to this?\r<br />\nRegards. I am using PHPExcel 1.7.9 and PHP 5.5ts on Windows8.<br />\n",
