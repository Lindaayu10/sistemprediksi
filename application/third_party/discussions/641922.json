Quoting from the main (news) page on the codeplex site:<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h4><b>2012-06-19</b> PHPExcel Moves to github!</h4>\r\nThe source repository for PHPExcel, together with its sister projects PHPWord and PHPPowerPoint under the auspices of PHPOffice. The repository can be found at\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel\"></a><a href=\"https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel\">https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel</a>, and the latest working development code is in the develop branch.<br>\r\nThis is the first part of series of changes in our development process which we believe will make it easier for us to do more frequent releases of better quality code. The next step will be CI integration for running automated unit testing against PHP 5.2,\r\n 5.3 and 5.4 using TravisCI.<br>\r\nWe shall be maintaining the CodePlex SVN Source repository in parallel for a time, but the github repository should be considered the definitive source.<br>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<br>\r\nand<br>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h4><b>2013-05-22</b> We are on Github!</h4>\r\nPlease remember that we have been using github as our source repository for nearly a year now.... source code has not been maintained here on Codeplex in all that time.\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to contribute, you can fork it. We do accept Pull Requests.<br>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<br>\r\nSo github has been the official site for the PHPExcel project for over 3 years<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, every time I try to shut down the Codeplex site, I get major outcry and have to keep it open (often from the same users that insist on maintaining PHP 5.2 backward compatibility).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<pre cols=\"72\">-- \r\nMark Baker\r\n\r\n _________\r\n|.  \\     \\-3\r\n|_J_/ PHP |\r\n|| |  __  |\r\n|| |m|  |m|\r\n\r\n I LOVE PHP\r\n</pre>\r\n",
