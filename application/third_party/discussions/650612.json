    "Html": "thanks for you quick answer<br />\nYes of course I used the magic functions....<br />\nBut in version 1.7.4, $objWriter-&gt;setIncludeCharts(true); makes php to fail (white page).<br />\nAs I was using a quite old version of the library, I just upgraded to 1.8.<br />\nNow it works ... but the graph is altered. It has lost its title (which is a dynamic title refering to the first sheet).<br />\nThe look and feel was also altered (see attached picture)<br />\nNote that Excel tells that the generated file is not correct and it has to recover it....(you know what I mean). <br />\nI thought this bug was fixed in the last versions of PHP Excel....<img src=\"http://asl-paludo.fr/pdf/phpexcel_debug.png\" alt=\"Image\" /><br />\n<h2>thanks</h2>\nI also loose the background color of the graph if ever I defined one...<br />\n",
