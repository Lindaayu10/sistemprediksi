I've tried to get it to work on my shared Linux hosting account, but the file would always be empty (0 bytes). <br>\r\nLinux Machine<br>\r\nPHP 5.2.1 - enabled with zip, gd &amp; xml_rpc<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I said alright, I'll try phpExcel on my windows box using Wamp server (http://www.wampserver.com/en/).<br>\r\nWindows PHP 5.2.8 - enabled with zip, gd &amp; xml_rpc<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result on the windows box was it created a file that was ~6k, but is &quot;unreadable&quot; by Excel 2007. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn both cases I am only trying to run the &quot;Hello world&quot; example as shown <br>\r\nhttp://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Examples&amp;referringTitle=Home<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I am able to see the excel file properly from that link, so it's not my excel installation).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan someone help me with these 2 cases? I know the requirements say use php_xml, but it seems like that dll is deprecated. I searched all over for it, but could not find it. (Only found posts saying xmlrpc / php5.2 should handle the xml, and don't need it. I also tried enabaling php_domxml. But that did not change anything.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information on these cases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n",
