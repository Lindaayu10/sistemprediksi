You have done a really good work, as others have said here, this seems to be one of the best php excel component over internet. Besides this, I am seeing that this component has its problems with memory&nbsp;with large amounts of data. Unfortunetly I need to&nbsp;use it&nbsp;with very large files in the projects I am working right&nbsp;now. I have read all the discussions an issues about the famous memory allocation problem also the solutions for some of them.&nbsp;They seem just to mitigate the problem or as partial solutions. The real solution, as you have said, is a caching&nbsp;mecanism (I think that the most realiable is the disk one). I really don&acute;t see any other solution to decrease dramatically&nbsp;the memory usage.&nbsp;I really like your componet but without these feature it is impossible for me to use it. When are you planning&nbsp;making these feature possible on phpexcel (if you are)? (seriously speaking and allowing estimations)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank you</p>",

We haven't really discussed this, so Maarten may even bump in here and say that this is not possible. There are also other important work items. Therefore, at very best, PHPExcel 1.7.2 may contain cell disk caching enhancements. But there could even be problems we aren't even aware of yet, so everything is very uncertain.</p>",
