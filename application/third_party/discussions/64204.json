You solved the problem, but I will explain some more for others.</p>\r\n<p>In the upcoming PHPExcel 1.7.0 we have full control over the default style for the workbook. This includes the font used for row numbers 1,2,3 and column letters A,B,C.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getDefaultStyle()-&gt;getFont()\r\n    -&gt;setName(<span style=\"color:#A31515\">'Arila'</span>)\r\n    -&gt;setSize(10);\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In MS Office Excel 2007, I do not know of a way to change the default font for a workbook. All you can do is to alter font settings in your preferences, and those settings will then be used as the default font in future workbooks that you create.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, in the Excel file format it is not possible to have different fonts for 1,2,3,..., A,B,C,... in the various sheets. Therefore <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">getDefaultStyle()</span> is now attached to the PHPExcel object rather than to the sheets. There was some confusion about this concept in PHPExcel 1.6.7, but hopefully it is straightened out now.</p>",
