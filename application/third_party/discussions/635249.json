However, the autoshape elements such as the arrows were not copied over.\r<br />\n<br />\nI was browsing to find answers and saw in <a href=\"https://phpexcel.codeplex.com/discussions/443508\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://phpexcel.codeplex.com/discussions/443508</a> that PHPExcel did not support this two years ago. I was wondering if this is still the case today?\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you!<br />\n",
