    "Html": "Hello all,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nfor a project of my boss i am making a program with the help of the PHPExcel engine.I bumped into a big problem. I first created a new spreadsheat from a mysql database. This database is quite big and the excel-file exsists out of 3 sheets with each 200 colums and 15000 rows. Generating the file took about 60 seconds with 160 MB peak RAM usage. This was no problem, because i only needed to generate it once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now I need to update the file 2 times a day. <br>\r\nI've made an phpform that sends info into the mysql database and then extracts the new info and adds it to the big excelfile. But with the engine i have to read the whole file first into $objPHPExcel with the reader.(takes 55 seconds)  Then i change/add the new information to the correct sheet and write the file with the excel writer. <br>\r\nBut this takes about 1 minute for just adding 2 rows, because I first have to read everything and then write everything again...:&lt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the question.<br>\r\nIs there a way/function in the writer that just updates sheets or some rows in an excisting Excel-file?? With the reader you can read parts with the readfilter, but with the writer i've seen nothing that can do it the other way around. Now I can't do nothing with the realfilter, because if I save the file, all other data that i did not read will be lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease help.<br>\r\nGr's Poss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBTW: I use Excel5 engine part.\r\n",

We are aware of the speed and memory issues, and this is already flagged as a work item and being addressed.\r\n",
