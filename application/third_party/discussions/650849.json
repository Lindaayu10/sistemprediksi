I would like all cell content to be entered explicitly such that long strings like &quot;1111111111111&quot; aren't treated as an int, or &quot;000002&quot; doesn't have the leading zeroes deleted. <br />\n<br />\nI've checked, and it seems that when doing this that the values are automatically pre-formatted. Thus &lt;td&gt;00001&lt;/td&gt; is stored as &quot;1&quot;, etc. <br />\n<br />\nI could perhaps extend the PHPExcel_Reader_HTML class and re-write some functions, but I'd rather not do this.<br />\n<br />\nIs there an easier way to store all values from an HTML table as explicit non-formatted values?<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",
