When using setIterateOnlyExistingCells(true), in some sheets, cells get shifted quite randomly (some rows are fine, and then some rows are shifted) so that they are no longer in the same column as they appear in the spreadsheet when opened in Excel.</p>\r\n<p>2. When using setIterateOnlyExistingCells(false), in some sheets, I end up with 16,000&#43; columns and who knows how many rows of mostly empty cells (from a sheet which contains around ~10 columns and ~100 rows), which results in &quot;out of memory&quot; situation eventually\r\n (exceeds 2.5GB).</p>\r\n<p>Is there anything that I can do about this so I can use either the one or the other iteration mode, but yet ensure that all the columns/rows are aligned exactly the same as when viewed in Excel, and only get cells up to the max column/row that contain an\r\n actual value.</p>\r\n<p>I am willing to provide sample files resulting in these problems to aid further investigation.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you!</p>\r\n<p>Regards</p>\r\n<p>Nik</p>\r\n",
