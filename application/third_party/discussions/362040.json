I would like to display prices in my excel sheet as follows:</p>\r\n<p>&euro; 1,50</p>\r\n<p>Now, what it is displaying, is:</p>\r\n<p>&euro;1,5</p>\r\n<p>So I would like a space between the &euro; and the price, and also ALWAYS display 2 numbers behind the comma. I am using this:</p>\r\n<p>$currencyFormat = iconv(&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;, &quot;UTF-8&quot;, '&euro; #,##0.00');<br>\r\n$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getStyle('F3:F100')-&gt;getNumberFormat()-&gt;setFormatCode($currencyFormat);</p>\r\n<p>Can someone point me in the right direction? Thanks a lot in advance!</p>\r\n<p>~Hardist</p>\r\n",
