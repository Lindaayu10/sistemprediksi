    "Html": "<p>Hey there!</p>\r\n<p>I have been looking for a solution to allow users to download search results generated by my database. I wanted to use jnlp to use the clipboard content and then I found PHPExcel. It occured to me that PHPExcel would be a great choice. I am wondering if it is possible to loop value to a spreadsheet in memory from my database one row at a time. I meant to set cell value by php variable in the URL, row by row and when the script is done running in my database I can go ahead to force download... Is this possible? Or is there any other way?</p>\r\n<p>Thank you in advance!</p>",

At its simplest, something like:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>$row = 1;\r\n$objPHPExcel = <span style=\"color:Blue\">new</span> PHPExcel();\r\n\r\n$result = mysql_query(<span style=\"color:#A31515\">&quot;SELECT id, name FROM mytable&quot;</span>);\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:Blue\">while</span> ($row = mysql_fetch_array($result, MYSQL_NUM)) {\r\n   $column = <span style=\"color:#A31515\">'A'</span>;\r\n   <span style=\"color:Blue\">foreach</span>($row <span style=\"color:Blue\">as</span> $columnData) {\r\n      $cellRef = $column.$row;\r\n      $objPHPExcel-&gt;setActiveSheetIndex(0)-&gt;setCellValue($cellRef, $columnData);\r\n      $column++;\r\n   }\r\n   $row++;\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#007700\">In practise, you'd need to consider your data types, particularly dates, and format them accordingly.</span></p>",

The problem is that it is an already made FileMaker database and users are accessing the data through iwp(Instant web publishing page that rendered from filemaker). The only way I can get the data out to php is either by URL variable one record at a time, or combine all data together and copy to the clipboard...</p>\r\n<p>Also, thank you for your concern about field format, I guess I am just going to save the data in csv so it shouldn't be a problem as long as I can get all the data into the php.</p>",

Fortunately, I have just learned that Filemaker has released API for php so I guess I will go that way instead of rebuilding the whole front-end with php. Thank you again for all your help, Mark!
