I keep receiving a LogicException\r\n when I try to set a title for a new worksheet. I also tried adding a call of the parent constructor in the WorksheetIterator, but that also did not work. It seems like PHP does not use the default constructor in the CachedIterator class anymore.</p>\r\n<p>Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'LogicException' with message 'In the constructor of PHPExcel_WorksheetIterator, parent::__construct() must be called and its exceptions cannot be cleared' in /.../classes/PHPExcel.php:515 Stack trace: #0 /.../classes/PHPExcel.php(515):\r\n PHPExcel_WorksheetIterator-&gt;internal_construction_wrapper(Object(PHPExcel)) #1 /.../classes/PHPExcel/ReferenceHelper.php(530): PHPExcel-&gt;getWorksheetIterator() #2 /.../classes/PHPExcel/Worksheet.php(693): PHPExcel_ReferenceHelper-&gt;updateNamedFormulas(Object(PHPExcel),\r\n 'Worksheet 1', 'Name of Worksheet') #3 /.../ExcelExport.php(286): PHPExcel_Worksheet-&gt;setTitle('Name of Worksheet')</p>\r\n<p>Any help would be highly appreciated!</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,<br>\r\nFlo</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>Hey Folks,</p>\r\n<p>I manged to make it work again, but the generated Excel spreadsheet is corrupted. To make it run under PHP 5.4.0beta1 you have to modify the PHPExcel_WorksheetIterator class. Currently, it extends the CachingIterator which constructor has been changed in the PHP beta. To make the code run, you can change the class definition to: \"implements Iterator\" instead of \"extends CachingIterator\". As I said, the generated file will be corrupt, but it is possible to open it in Excel using the repair functionality, see: https://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/repairing-corrupted-files-in-excel-HA001034656.aspx</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,<br />Flo</p>",
