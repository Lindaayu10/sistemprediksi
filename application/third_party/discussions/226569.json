When I get the properties of .xlsx files it works fine but not with the .xls. I am not able to get few properties with the 1.7.3c code like company and category. Please can any one help me to short out this problem.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks &amp; Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Jitendra Saklani</p>",

I've been doing some work on the document properties in all the readers over the last week, including the code for the Excel5 Reader to process the &quot;DocumentSummaryInformation&quot; stream, so the latest SVN code does now include reading both company and category from Excel5 (xls) workbooks. If you download from the daily downloads under the &quot;Source Code&quot; tab here on the web site, you'll have access to this latest code.</p>\r\n<p>Note that the Excel5 Reader doesn't yet read user-defined &quot;custom&quot; properties (although these are now supported by the Excel2007, Excel2003XML and OOCalc Readers), and I haven't yet updated the Writer code to support &quot;extended&quot; or &quot;custom&quot; properties. This is something that I'm targetting for the next release to provide consistency across the core code.</p>",
