Also, does PHPExcel convert formulas in cells to PHP as it reads a file in?<br>\r\nIn an earlier thread I had a problem opening a file. The problem was that it inflated the memory past PHP's limits, the file I found was extremely complex since it contained macros and a lot of formulas (formulas that could be omitted or simply conserved as text). I found myself increasing PHP's memory limits beyond what was resonable. I created a filter for the file and that's when I found how complex the file was. Saving the filtered file corrupted it to a point where Excel couldn't read it. The whole file used two worksheets and without the second sheet any part of the first wouldn't display right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have any suggestions as to how to handle a file like this it would appreciated.<br>\r\n",
