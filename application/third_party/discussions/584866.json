    "Html": "Hi. I am trying to set cells in a worksheet to VERTICAL_DISTRIBUTED and I just can't get it to work. The same code I am using will set the cells to VERTICAL_TOP, VERTICAL_CENTER and VERTICAL_JUSTIFY. It obviously defaults to VERTICAL_BOTTOM ok too.\r<br />\n<br />\nI've checked Alignment.php and the const VERTICAL_DISTRIBUTED entry is there and I am using PHPExcel 1.8.0. The Excel version I am using is from MS Office 2010 (version 14), but I am obviously writing for any version of Excel from 2007 onwards.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs anyone aware of any issues with using VERTICAL_DISTRIBUTED and, if so, is there a fix? I've looked at Alignment.php, but there is nothing obviously wrong or missing that I can see. Although that doesn't mean it's not there as some of the programming is a little beyond where I am at the moment.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for any assistance.<br />\n",
