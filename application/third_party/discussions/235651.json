This means that the PHPExcel object has no &quot;knowledge&quot; that a chart even existed in the original workbook file. When\r\n the file is saved, the Writers&nbsp;can only create those elements that exist in the PHPExcel object, but no charts exist in the PHPExcel object, so no chart can be written. Until I've completed writing code for the PHPExcel object to hold chart information,\r\n and modified the Readers to load that information from a workbook into the PHPExcel object, and the Writers to save it, charts won't be supported.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, I've built the code objects for storing chart information in the PHPExcel object, and updated the Excel2007 Reader to load that information, and am working on the Excel2007 Writer so that the chart information can be saved. This is intended for\r\n the next release. Updating the Excel5 Reader and Writer will follow in due course, but won't be available until next year.</p>\r\n",
