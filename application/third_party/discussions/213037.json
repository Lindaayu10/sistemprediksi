What we want is to create a php page for input and output with the business logic that exists in the excel.</p>\r\n<p>I cannot find any reference to creating a form like this. I would use ajax to repopulate the output after a change to the input but this seems to require reloading.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Since in this scenario the xls writing and all of the other functionality associated with settings properties formatting etc. are not required is it possible to turn these features off to decrease load time.</p>",
