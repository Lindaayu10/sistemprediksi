I was having issues, so I created this simple test:</p>\r\n<p>$objPHPExcel = new PHPExcel();<br>$objPHPExcel-&gt;setActiveSheetIndex(0)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt;setCellValue('A1', 'test');<br><br>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setTitle('Simple');<br>$objPHPExcel-&gt;setActiveSheetIndex(0);</p>\r\n<p>$objWriter = new PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007($objPHPExcel);<br>$objWriter-&gt;setOffice2003Compatibility(true);<br>$objWriter-&gt;save(&quot;report.xls&quot;);</p>\r\n<p>It creates the file just fine, but when you try and open the file in Excel 2003 I get the error message &quot; This file is not in a recognizable format.&quot;&nbsp; If I open it anyway, it's all jiberish. When I open the same file in 2007 I get the following message: &quot;The file you are trying to open is in a different format than specified by the file extension...&quot; however if I open it it's as expected. I'm I totally miss understanding how this works?</p>\r\n<p>thanks</p>\r\n<p>summer</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
