Really!<br>\r\nI'm just reading Excel 5 files - and if file contains only 4 columns and 1000 rows with just 0 as values in cells, <br>\r\nmemory usage is about 75 mb.. Too much, isn't it? Is there any way to make it less?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe there are some memory leaks? If there are not, maybe you can add ability to read files in, let's say, &quot;batch&quot; mode: read one  object (cell, row, image..), make operations with it's properties/methods, and replace this object with the next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemory usage is very important - cause I'm (sugessting, not only..) using side PHP hosting, and most of  hosters have<br>\r\n<i>memory_limit = 64 MB</i> <br>\r\nor even less in <strong>php.ini</strong>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, great thanks for your work. <br>\r\nWaiting for an answer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",

    "Html": "Same here. I use it to upload Excel files of a few kb, to around 18MB (Excel 2003) or 9-10MB in Excel 2007. However we will have to do files much bigger, like 30-40MB and maybe more. Previously (I inherited this website) the app used the abandoned 'PHP ExcelReader' library, which worked OK-ish but had an odd issue related to UTF-8. So I chopped that out and put in PHPExcel instead. A truly fantastic app - and perfect UTF-8 importing, but very memory hungry. Where before 100MB was fine, I've now had to go to 1024MB to get an upload to work (and that's with files half the size that we will need later). So with the bigger files we may well have to use something else, which is a shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA &quot;lite&quot; version maybe, would be nice, to use in reading large files - a fairly common function; uploading large amounts of data into a CMS or database. E.g. we have 80,000 products, and will soon have 300,000. The only sensible way for us is to have the sales dept maintain various Excel files. This enables bulk upload and a pretty painless product maintenance regime. It all hinges on the ability to read/upload Excel files though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo idea if the architecture would suit a 'lite' version, or whether there would be demand, but this type of bulk updating seems fairly common. Sorry if I went on a bit. Just thinking on the page really. Great app, wish it was lighter on memory is all. Thanks for all the work that's gone into it.\r\n",
