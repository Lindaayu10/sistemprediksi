    "Html": "When I enter a certain formula, i.e. =Now(), in a cell when creating a spreadsheet using PHPExcel, it is displayed as text instead of correctly acting like a formula and returning a value.&nbsp; This seems to be related to some obnoxious behavior of Excel, whereby it sometimes will display the text of a formula instead of the calculated results of a formula--probably because the cell itself is being interpreted as text.&nbsp; For some background on this problem, see <a href=\"http://www.mrexcel.com/archive2/17600/19935.htm\">http://www.mrexcel.com/archive2/17600/19935.htm</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, for the problem at hand in PHPExcel.&nbsp; The Now() formula will display as text depending on the formatting applied to it.&nbsp; If it is set to &quot;general&quot; formatting, then it displays a number.&nbsp; If it is set to any of the date formats, or if no formatting is applied, it displays the formula as text:<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//gives me the string &quot;=Now()&quot; in the cell<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$excel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValueByColumnAndRow(5,7, '=Now()');<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$excel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getStyleByColumnAndRow(5,7)-&gt;getNumberFormat()-&gt;setFormatCode('m/d/yyyy h:mm');<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//also gives me the string &quot;=Now()&quot; in the cell<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$excel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValueByColumnAndRow(5,7, '=Now()');<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//gives me&nbsp;a formula in the cell with the value&nbsp;39673.44 being returned (i.e. the current timestamp I believe)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$excel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValueByColumnAndRow(5,7, '=Now()');<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$excel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getStyleByColumnAndRow(5,7)-&gt;getNumberFormat()-&gt;setFormatCode('General');<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf in either of the first two examples after the spreadsheet is generated, I place my mouse in the cell as if I were going to edit the formula, and then simply hit &quot;ENTER&quot; as if I had edited it (but I don't change anything), then Excel seems to get itsself straigtened out, and it finally correctly interprets the cell as a formula, and displays it correctly with the formatting I had set.&nbsp; <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have tried to explicity set the type of the cell, using the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$excel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getCellByColumnAndRow(5,7)-&gt;setValueExplicit('=Now()', PHPExcel_Cell_DataType::TYPE_FORMULA);<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut this does not seem to help.&nbsp; <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am using the excel5 writer, and the latest version 1.6.2 of PHPExcel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs there something in PHPExcel that is not outputting the formula as a formula, but as text instead?&nbsp; Is the setValueExplicit not really tellling Excel what the cell data type is?&nbsp; Is this an unavoidable consequence of Excel not keeping track of what is a formula and what is text correctly?<br>\r\n",
