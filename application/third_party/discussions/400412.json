    "Html": "<p>1. Highly unlikely, but not completely impossible. PHPExcel generates a random prefix to use for each worksheet. The code is visible if you want to check how it works for yourself.</p>\r\n<p>2. Almost certainly, though it depends how much your script is accessing the cells. If I was hitting the kind of demands that you're getting, then I'd be using something like redis instead of memcache, and would write a redis cache storage object.</p>\r\n<p>If you're hitting 1000 concurrent users, you should really be running multiple servers and multiple memcache servers anyway. That's pretty serious activity. You should also be refactoring PHPExcel activity to background processes in that case, using message queuing or similar.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
