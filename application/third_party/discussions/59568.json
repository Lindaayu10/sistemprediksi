Thanks.</p>\r\n<p>Now got to work out how I pop it up so the user can download it, but sure that's in the docs or just geenral PHP somewhere. This library looks excellent and I really hope it works solidly for the project I'm doing (which needs to generate a lot of Excel spreadsheets).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
