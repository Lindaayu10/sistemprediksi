Whatever i try displays it in the cell as 'HEADER. However if I double click that cell in Excel it autoformats the way I want and strips the apostrophe out of the cell and leaves it in the formula bar. \r<br />\nAnd excel does that as well in a new cell where I type 'WHATEVER it will just display WHATEVER in the cell and still display 'WHATEVER in the formula bar. \r<br />\n<br />\nHow can I do this so it's already displayed that way when I create my Excel file with phpExcel?\r<br />\n<br />\nThis is how I'm inserting the values right now. \r<br />\n<br />\n$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValueExplicit($currentColumn.$currentRow, $data, PHPExcel_Cell_DataType::TYPE_STRING);\r<br />\n<br />\n$data would just be a string preceded by an apostrophe. <br />\n",
