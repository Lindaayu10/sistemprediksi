It's just perfect for what I need.<br />\nI'm doing quite a simple thing here, I have a .xlsx that I need to show &quot;as is&quot; inside an HTML page.<br />\nHere is the code I use to achieve this:<br />\n<pre><code>    set_include_path(get_include_path() . PATH_SEPARATOR . '../../../Classes/');\n    include 'PHPExcel/IOFactory.php';\n\n    $inputFileType = 'Excel2007';\n    $inputFileName = '../Comparison_Matrix_v2.xlsx';\n    $inputWorkseet = 'web';\n\n    $objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader($inputFileType);\n    $objReader-&gt;setLoadSheetsOnly($inputWorkseet);\n    $objPHPExcel = $objReader-&gt;load($inputFileName);\n\n    $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;removeRow(1,2);\n\n    $objWriter = new PHPExcel_Writer_HTML($objPHPExcel);\n    echo $objWriter-&gt;generateStyles(true); \n    echo $objWriter-&gt;generateSheetData();</code></pre>\n\nNow my problem is with $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;removeRow(1,2);<br />\nIt successfully removes the first two rows (which are a title and a blank row) but I need to delete the 10 first rows. When I do this:<br />\n<pre><code>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;removeRow(1,10);</code></pre>\n\nThe layout is gone for the beginning of my document and I don't understand why. Do you think it may be because of my xlsx file? How can I make sure of it?<br />\nMaybe there's another approach, the ideal would be to set the cells range I need and send only this range to HTML writer, but I did not find how to do this.<br />\n<br />\nThanks<br />\n<br />\nEDIT : the whole thing is hosted on a private server under my complete control, CENTOS 6.3 x86_64, PHP 5.3.21 and PHPExcel fresh from yesterday so it must be 1.7.8, you can find the xlsx file I'm using here : <a href=\"http://orpalisweb.com/test/Comparison_Matrix_v2.xlsx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://orpalisweb.com/test/Comparison_Matrix_v2.xlsx</a><br />\n",

    "Html": "I've just noticed that the columns doesn't have the same width, B to G should have the same width (63 pixels) but they don't, any idea why?<br />\n<br />\nEDIT : OK, I managed to find a workaround for my HTML writer behavior, I'm not deleting rows anymore just hide them and it's working as expected now (and a little faster or it's just me?). So the only thing now is the floating width thing.<br />\n",
