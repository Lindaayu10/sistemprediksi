(I use only a few of the functions of PHPExcel, but they are incredibly valuable)\r<br />\n<br />\nThat being said, while looking at, say, PHPExcel_1.8.0_doc\\Examples\\07reader.php, and other example files, I began to realize there is a big license blurb at the top.\r<br />\nSo question: do i need to copy that blurb into the section of my code that uses PHPExcel? It's quite chunky<br />\n",
