This does not work at all however, as I get the following errors:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Wiki/View.aspx?title=08-May-2008%2009%3a19%3a00\">08-May-2008 09:19:00</a> Error Caught: 2 Division by zero /Users/cendrizzi/Zend/workspaces/DefaultWorkspace/R3D0/ThirdPartyLibs/php_excel/Classes/PHPExcel/Calculation.php(673) : runtime-created function 1 Array<br /><a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/PHPExcel/Wiki/View.aspx?title=08-May-2008%2009%3a19%3a02\">08-May-2008 09:19:02</a> PHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of 268435456 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 80367424 bytes) in /Users/cendrizzi/Zend/workspaces/DefaultWorkspace/R3D0/include/cor/class/COR.class.php on line 323<br /><br />So phpexcel seems to be calculating it anyway, and ignoring the condition.  Looking through the code, it looks like A LOT of work has gone into this function stuff.<br /><br />I'm not yet totally aware of how phpexcel works, but I was most troubled to see this didn't even work on the spreadsheet (as opposed to just spitting it out to html as I do by default).  Why is phpexcel parsing and computing functions on the spreadsheet?  Doesn't excel do it for you if you just pass it through to the cell?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Clark<br />",

It does not execute the code, but does warn you about a possible bug.<br /><br />Try the following code on PHP to reproduce this behaviour:<br /><pre style=\"background-color:#ECECEC; border:dashed .1em #3E62A6; font-family:Consolas, Courier New, Courier, Monospace; font-size:1em; margin-top:0; padding:.5em; height:auto; overflow:auto; overflow-x:auto; overflow-y:auto;\">\r\n&lt;?php\r\nfunction STATEMENT_IF($condition, $onTrue, $onFalse) {\r\n   return $condition ? $onTrue : $onFalse;\r\n}\r\n \r\n$x = create_function('', 'return STATEMENT_IF(0&gt;0, 5/0, \"n/a\");');\r\necho call_user_func($x);\r\n?&gt;\r\n</pre><br />I suppressed this error in the calculation engine, so you should not be seeing it anymore.<br /><br />2) Can you provide some more details on your script?
