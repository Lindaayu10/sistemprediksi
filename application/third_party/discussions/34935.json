I have a class\r\nwhich has a method that takes a PHPExcel_Worksheet object and a\r\nreference to a file. A PHPExcel_Worsheet_drawing object is created and\r\nthe image is added to it. I then set the worksheet to the active\r\nworksheet of the PHPExcel_Worksheet object. This method is called each\r\ntime a chart object is added. The problem is that when I open the xlsx\r\nfile it generates I get an error about some content not being\r\navailable. Its always the last image. Also if I set the sheet it sues\r\nto always be something other than what the last one should be then the\r\ncontent is loaded by Excel without problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI created a simmple function to test everything inline without passing it off to different object and then everything works.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked through the XML but I\r\ncould not find anything wrong with it. The image resource is included\r\nin it but Excel is not referencing it for some reason. (The output xlsx file is attached in the issue tracker).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have tested it using the Excel5 writer and it works correctly with that writer so I am assuming there is a problem with the Excel 2007 writer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anyone can help me I would appreciate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew<br>\r\n",
