The file needs to be parse and and updated on a website I've built already. The site was developed in PHP using Code Igniter.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe file is not a CVS or XML file masquerading as .xls because I have tried to open it up in a text editor and it's in some sort of binary format.\r<br />\n<br />\nI know it's a valid Excell file because I can open it in my open copy of Excel on my mac.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe code I'm using in my PHP to load the file is this:<br />\n<pre><code>      $inputFileType = PHPExcel_IOFactory::identify(FCPATH .&quot;files/&quot;. $file);                   </code></pre>\n\n$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader($inputFileType); <br />\n<pre><code>    try {\n        $this-&gt;excel = $objReader-&gt;load(FCPATH .&quot;files/&quot;. $file);\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        die ($e-&gt;getMessage());\n    } \n</code></pre>\n\nBut it won't work no matter what I try. I get this error message in my logs.\r<br />\n<br />\nUncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'The filename /var/www/mywebsite/my-webapp/files/Digital-Pacing-Report.xls is not recognised as an OLE file'\r<br />\n<br />\nI would appreciate any suggestions at this point. I've tried loading it using the ''Excel2007' and &quot;'Excel2003XML'&quot; and it makes no difference. As far as I can tell PHPExcell can't even identify the file type.\r<br />\n<br />\nHelp please.\r<br />\n<br />\nPhil<br />\n",
