I would expect a &quot;headers already sent out&quot; warning and I don't see any markup when exiting before the output file is generated.  It's certainly possible I'm missing a blank space though as I'm still familiarizing myself with the new back end.<br />\n",

I had the headers setup as shown in 01simple-download-xls.php and an excel file was downloaded that contained the glyphs. \r<br />\n<br />\nThe new URL routing system our site used caused this error (was being redirected through the PHPExcel handling twice hence an Excel file being created AND it containing Excel headers in the actual file).\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm bypassing the routing system to get this to work now. We also had some PHP files that opened PHP tags to late in the file (leaving empty whitespace in the beginning) or closed PHP tags too early (leaving empty whitespace at the end). These had to be corrected as well to get the output to work correctly. Thanks again.<br />\n",
