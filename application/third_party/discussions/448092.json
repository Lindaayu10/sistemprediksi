However when i load them in my cakephp application with the code below, i get an empty result:<br />\n<pre><code>array(\n    (int) 0 =&gt; array(\n        (int) 0 =&gt; null\n    )\n)</code></pre>\n\nHowever, if i open the .xlsx in Excel first and then save it. (I don't change any values or anything). The code works flawlessly with the saved file and i get exactly the results that i want:<br />\n<pre><code>array(\n    (int) 0 =&gt; array(\n        (int) 0 =&gt; 'Aa',\n        (int) 1 =&gt; 'Bb',\n        (int) 2 =&gt; '1',\n        (int) 3 =&gt; '2',\n        (int) 4 =&gt; '3',\n        (int) 5 =&gt; '4',\n        (int) 6 =&gt; '5'\n    ), etc.</code></pre>\n\nUnfortunately it's not practical for me to open and save all the files first before i load them in my web application so has anyone encountered this problem and knows what's going on?<br />\n<pre><code>        $objPHPExcel = PHPExcel_IOFactory::load('files/test.xlsx');\n        $sheetData = $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;toArray(null, false, false, false);\n        debug($sheetData);</code></pre>\n\nPHP 5.4.7<br />\nPHPExcel 1.7.9<br />\n",

The system is built with Silverlight. Can't really give you a direct link and I am not able to figure out what they actually use to generate the files.<br />\n",
