I would like to do something like:<br />\n<pre><code>...\n$table = array();\nforeach($dataset as $data){\n    $drawing = new PHPExcel_Worksheet_MemoryDrawing();\n    $drawing-&gt;setImageResource($data-&gt;getImage());\n    ...\n    $table[] = array($drawing);\n}\n$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;fromArray($table);\n...</code></pre>\n\nSadly fromArray does not seem to accept drawings inside the array. But I also do not want to statically set the coordinates of every image myself. \r<br />\nIs there a way to make this work or do I have to rewrite my code to use iterators instead of fromArray?<br />\n",

    "Html": "<code>fromArray()</code> is used to put content <strong>inside</strong> cells (in the same way as, for example, <code>setCellValue()</code>); but in Excel, images aren't stored inside cells, they are <strong>overlaid</strong>, effectively displayed over the cell, so <code>fromArray()</code> can never be used with images....\r<br />\nThe actual positioning of an overlaid image can be relative to the top-left corner of a cell, with x and y offsets, but otherwise it has no direct connection to any cell<br />\n",
