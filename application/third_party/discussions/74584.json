I realize DLL's are not a *nix thing. I thought maybe that was some generic term for all PHP stuff in the php.ini. I don't see anybody adding extensions via .so after doing a few google searches. I only see mention of it for *nix environments at compile time. It is unclear to me if it has to be &quot;enabled&quot; at that time and can't be later on.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote style=\"border:solid .1em #ccc;font-style:italic;margin:.25em 1em 0 1em;padding:0 .25em 0 .25em\"><br></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote style=\"border:solid .1em #ccc;font-style:italic;margin:.25em 1em 0 1em;padding:0 .25em 0 .25em\">I am using the PHP that came with SL. I did not compile it. Unfortunately I also know so little about it I don't know how to track any of this down. In my phpinfo() there is a section &quot;configure command&quot; that has things like -enable-&lt;various thing&gt; or -with-&lt;various&gt; things. I do not see -enable-zip.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote style=\"border:solid .1em #ccc;font-style:italic;margin:.25em 1em 0 1em;padding:0 .25em 0 .25em\"><br></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote style=\"border:solid .1em #ccc;font-style:italic;margin:.25em 1em 0 1em;padding:0 .25em 0 .25em\"><br></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote style=\"border:solid .1em #ccc;font-style:italic;margin:.25em 1em 0 1em;padding:0 .25em 0 .25em\"><strong>SFDonovan wrote:</strong><br></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote style=\"border:solid .1em #ccc;font-style:italic;margin:.25em 1em 0 1em;padding:0 .25em 0 .25em\">\r\n<p><a id=\"ctl00_ctl00_MasterContent_Content_PostRepeater_ctl04_UserNameLink\" href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/jorfanakis\">jorfanakis</a>,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I'm having the same problem on my Mac OSX running 10.5 with PHP 5.2.5</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Should we be adding</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>extension=php_zip.so instead of uncommenting extension=php_zip.dll</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Download php-5.3 from http://us2.php.net/downloads.php</p>\r\n<p>sudo the following</p>\r\n<p>2. cp pcre.h from php-5.3/ext/pcre/pcrelib to /usr/php/ext/pcre</p>\r\n<p>3. pecl install zip</p>\r\n<p>It says it completes and all one needs to do is add exactly what you suggested to the php.ini. extension=zip.so</p>\r\n<p>It took me a bit to figure out the php.ini setup too. So in case you have not. In /etc/hosts there is php.ini.default. It says to copy that to php.ini and modify that. I also read in a wordpress support page that all those timezone warning can be eliminated if you set the date.timezone line to something meaningful. The example I saw was Europe/Dublin and America/Chicago so I have tried America/Denver. This default ini file does not display errors so you may want to toggle that too.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I haven't had a chance to see if any of this works and may not today so I thought I would post what I have done so far in hopes that it may be useful.</p>",
