But it has not died in ru_RU locale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simple code does not work:<br>\r\nsetlocale(LC_ALL, &quot;ru_RU.CP1251&quot;);<br>\r\nrequire_once&nbsp; 'PHPExcel/IOFactory.php';<br>\r\n$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel2007');<br>\r\n$objPHPExcel = $objReader-&gt;load(&quot;template/inv.xlsx&quot;);&nbsp; //the .xlsx file has column with non-default width<br>\r\n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel2007');<br>\r\n$objWriter-&gt;save('inv/temp.xlsx');<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the second feature: after changing locale to ru_RU PHPExcel works well only with rounded row heights (like 15,00, 20,00, 100,00 etc.).&nbsp; Any non-rounded height (like 15,75 or 20,15) will corrupt output file. Rounding column widths does not help anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tested this code with latest sources from SVN (Changeset 16265).\r\n",

After few experiments I have localized it. It’s non- default font with ru_RU now. Maybe there are something other errors hiding in this file. I don’t know. What have I to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis file is one of my templates, as I told you before your vocation. It’s “heavy formatted”. It has “boldings”, “sizing”, cell margins, alignments, wraps, borders and filter. Basically I need to read and rewrite it with all formatting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd interesting feature is that it works on old Windows server even with old sources.<br>\r\nHelp me.<br>\r\n",
