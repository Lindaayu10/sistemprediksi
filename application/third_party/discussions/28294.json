This is fine, except for html files.... as the user will download the html file so how do I make the html file that is created make an image tag like:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;img  style=&quot;position: relative; left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 140px; height: 78px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.domain.com/images/logo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nrather than the current:<br>\r\n&lt;img  style=&quot;position: relative; left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 140px; height: 78px;&quot; src=&quot;./images/logo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso is it possible to make the system for html and PDF files to take sheat 0 do its thing,  then sheet 1 then sheet 2 and so one?  making one long file (many pages) rather than restricting it to be just on excel sheet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd last but not least the document &quot;PHPExcel developer documentation.doc&quot; in 6.6.1 says &quot;<span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'trebuchet ms','sans-serif'\">You can write a .htm file using the following code:&quot;  should be .PDF<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks<br>\r\nChris</span>\r\n",
