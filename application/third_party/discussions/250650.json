When I use a location on file system xls or xlsx file are writen correctly.</p>\r\n<p>I used vbindiff to find difference between file outputed to php://output and then saved through browser (FF3.6.13 and Chromium browser) and file written directly to, say, /usr/tmp.</p>\r\n<p>I found that there is one byte of difference at the beggining of the file saved through browser in both cases: hex 0A.</p>\r\n<p>I have read the FAQ and the documentation and took care not to output anything else to buffer before or after calling writer's save method.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Where is the catch?

It looks like your script is outputting a single line feed somewhere. Watch out for blank lines after a closing ?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nMark Baker<br>\r\n",
