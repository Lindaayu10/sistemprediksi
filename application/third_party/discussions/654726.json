In the examples (PHP code how to use PHPExcel) I don't see any XML code (!?).\r<br />\n<br />\nI'am asking because I work on a project to store spreadsheet content (from Excel or OpenOffice) as (when possible XML-) text in a MySQL database. This to search through it much more easily then through many files.\r<br />\n<br />\nMartin<br />\n",

As the content itself represents already (XML) text, it makes sense to me to use it 1:1. The goal is not to transform one spreadsheet table into one database table but to transform a certain area of a spreadsheet table into a database entity...\r<br />\n<br />\nMartin<br />\n",
