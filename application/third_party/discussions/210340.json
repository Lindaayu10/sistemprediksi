My goal is to use your library, so I can <em>process</em> some data from multiple Excel files, and send such data to a database, per file. I'm doing something like:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:blue\">foreach</span>( $file_list <span style=\"color:blue\">as</span> $<span style=\"color:blue\">file</span> ) {\r\n\r\n\t$book = PHPExcel_IOFactory::load( $path . $<span style=\"color:blue\">file</span> );\r\n\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>So, inside the <strong>foreach</strong> I'm also sending the current file-loaded data to the database, but after five files, I get a memory error:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<pre>Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 33554432 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 50688 bytes) in /var/www/test/classes/PHPExcel/Shared/OLERead.php on line 76</pre>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Is there a way to <strong>__destruct</strong> the object after each file is loaded, so space is reserved (made free) for the next file, instead of accumulating it, or do you rather know of a work-around for this?</p>\r\n<p>Please let me know any suggestions you have.</p>\r\n<p>Thank in advance.</p>",
