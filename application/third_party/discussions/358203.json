The PHPExcel readers load the file into a PHPExcel object where it can then be manipulated as necessary. Subsequently, you can use one of PHPExcel's writers (such as the HTML writer) to render that PHPExcel object in an appropriate format and save to file or send to php://output</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
