    "Html": "<p>That does seem an inordinately long time.</p>\r\n<p>I just ran some tests against an xlsx&nbsp;file with 2 worksheets of 3,500 rows by 18 columns, and that took less than 4.5 seconds to read using the latest code, and 5.1 seconds using the 1.7.1 code (Windows, PHP 5.2.8, and a relatively slow processor).... so taking nearly 70 seconds for your workbook does seem excessive.</p>\r\n<p>Quite how you can speed up the load I'm not sure. I assume you're explicitly instantiating the Excel2007 reader rather than letting the IO factory determine which reader to use.</p>\r\n<p>I'll run a few more tests with some larger worksheets, see what settings/options have most affect on the load time.</p>",
