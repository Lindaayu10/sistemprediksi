To fix the problem, all I had to do was either load the file using a different reader class, or convert it first using the convert function in Excel2007.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for php_xml.dll, I can't find it anywhere so am now assuming that it was assimilated into the main-stream php packages long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a programming note, how difficult would it be for PHPExcel to determine the version of the xls (or xlsx) file all by itself? You could have a method called <strong>loadExcelReader(&quot;<em>file.xls</em>&quot;)</strong> which would find the correct reader to match the file. \r\n",
