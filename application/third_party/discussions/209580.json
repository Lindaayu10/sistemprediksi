Does the latest version contains this facility.</p>\r\n<p>And i also have another query.</p>\r\n<p>If i have a template which consists of some test data and images. I could load the data and write the data on the fly which again contains the same images.</p>\r\n<p>but if i try to implement the same by having charts instead of images, its changing the data on fly but the charts are not coming.</p>\r\n<p>and the same is in the case of auto-filter options.</p>\r\n<p>MY QUESTION IS</p>\r\n<p>1. &nbsp; If i could get the image object from the template and can write in the new xls file, why can't i not getting this chart.</p>\r\n<p>2. Even if i have the auto filter is enabled in the template, i am not getting it in the written file. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For you information i am specifying the full&nbsp; range such as</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; $obPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setActiveFilter('A1:c5');</p>\r\n<p>3. Is that possibe to change the chart on the fly by passing some objects.</p>\r\n<p>4. Can i genrate a chart using some third party tool and is this possible to embed the whole chart area in a specified cell range</p>\r\n<p>Please cleat it out&nbsp; and help me in this regard.</p>\r\n<p>Its more urgent.</p>\r\n<p>please reply asap,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>satdev</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "Html": "<p>When reading workbooks, PHPExcel ignores any elements that it cannot handle: it simply does not read them, so&nbsp; when a newly read file is written back, it will only contain those elements that PHPExcel could read... hence charts, pivot tables, forms, macros and other VBA code will all be lost.</p>\r\n<p>Charting will be coming this Summer. It's not the easiest coding, and has taken some time to write, but I've already written the basic code for reading charts with the Excel2007 reader, and started work on the Excel2007 writer: so sometime around July/August, expect chart read/write for Excel2007, with&nbsp; other readers/writers to follow over the Autumn (Fall for the Americans reading).</p>\r\n<p>I've also included wrapper code for rendering charts to jpg/gif/etc files using standard PHP Charting libraries. The initial wrapper is for jpGraph, but I'm hoping to provide interfaces for graphpite and other charting libraries subsequently.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

In your last post, you ahve mentioned that we can expect the charts fucntionality during july/August</p>\r\n<p>of this year. Is that version released or yet to released.</p>\r\n<p>Please clear this. I am afraid, if we couldn't have this fucntionality in this release, then in my project i have to struggle a lot</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>satdev</p>",
