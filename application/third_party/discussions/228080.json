Here is a sample snipit where things slow:</p>\r\n<p>foreach ($rowsToDelete as $k =&gt; $v)<br>{<br>&nbsp;//echo $v.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;<br>&nbsp;$activeSheet-&gt;removeRow($v, 1);</p>\r\n<p>}</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Removing rows (or columns) is inherently slow because, not only does the code logic remove the cells and renumber the row of every cell that lies below the deleted row, it also checks through every cell in the worksheet looking for formulae that reference cells in the deleted row (or below) and adjusts them to match the new row numbers... likewise with any named ranges, cell validation rules, autofilters, etc. It's actually doing&nbsp; great deal of work. Similarly, inserting new rows/columns as also very intensive.</p>\r\n<p>One way you might improve the speed of execution is to delete the rows in reverse order... so instead of deleting row 10, then row 20, then row 30... delete row 30 first, then row 20, then row 10.</p>\r\n<p>It's also faster if you can delete rows in contiguous blocks where possible, so if you want to delete rows 1-4, 6-8 and 12,</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>$activeSheet-&gt;removeRow(12, 1);\r\n$activeSheet-&gt;removeRow(6, 3);\r\n$activeSheet-&gt;removeRow(1, 4);\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>It's still not going to be instantaneous, but should be quicker</p>",
