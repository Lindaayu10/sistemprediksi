Whenever you set cell values, always use UTF-8.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExample:<br>\r\n<code>\r\n// test.php<br>\r\n$cell-&gt;setValue('öäüß');<br>\r\n</code>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you do like the above in test.php, make sure that <code>test.php</code> is encoded in UTF-8 (without BOM). ISO-8859-1 or the like will not work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot all text editors are good for writing UTF-8 without BOM. I like the free Notepad++ because it has specific menu options: &quot;Format &gt; Encode in UTF-8 without BOM&quot; etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilarly, if you are retrieving data from database, make sure you are reading UTF-8 strings. Encoding will depend on database settings and database connection settings. There are really many pitfalls.<br>\r\n",
