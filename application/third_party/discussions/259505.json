I want to calculate all the fields so that everything is updated.</p>\n<p>3. I want to export the first spreadsheet.index(0), and delete spreadsheet.index(1) - without formulas.</p>\n<p>The user should get an excel file with plain values, same formatting without any formulas! The user should also NOT have spreadsheet.index(1) as this index contains business logic NOT for the user.</p>\n<p>Is this even possible with phpExcel?</p>\n<p>Regards,<br /> Kim Steinhaug (<a href=\"mailto:kim@steinhaug.com\">kim@steinhaug.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.steinhaug.com/\">www.steinhaug.com</a>)&nbsp;</p>",
