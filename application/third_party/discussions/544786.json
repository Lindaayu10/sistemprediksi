    "Html": "Hello, my company currently uses PHPExcel(Excel 5 writer) with a leaflet generator. Our client is able to input images from a database into the leaflet, and it is exported as an Excel file(there is a base template file, image and text are added to the template using PHPExcel). We have tried multiple versions of PHPExcel and have not been able to perfect the final appearance.We are currently using version 1.7.6.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://i60.tinypic.com/3088x0l.png\" alt=\"Image\" /><br />\n<br />\nOriginally, the images in the final file were distorted horizontally(see image). I found that this problem was solved by changing the default font and size with the following line of code(this particular font and size prevented the images from distorting).<br />\n<blockquote>\n$objPHPExcel-&gt;getDefaultStyle()-&gt;getFont()-&gt;setName('Calibri')-&gt;setSize(11);<br />\n</blockquote>\nThe images were then output without any horizontal distortion, as in the next image.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://i58.tinypic.com/24fy2px.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br />\n<br />\nHowever, using the line of code above, it has caused problems with the print area of the file. While images are no longer stretched, there is now an issue with the print area. In the below image, the print area has expanded and caused the print area to expand into a second page. In other cases, the print area has been narrowed, adding white space to the right margin.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://i60.tinypic.com/15f3ouq.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://i58.tinypic.com/34qsr5d.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" /><br />\n<br />\nI would like to be able to have the images added to the graph without distortion, but also without causing any changes to the print area. How is this possible?<br />\n",
