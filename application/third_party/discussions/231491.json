But when I do this:</p>\r\n<pre>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValue($fieldName, &quot;00120&quot;);</pre>\r\n<p>The cell is set to &quot;120&quot;. I've tried:</p>\r\n<pre>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getStyle($fieldName)-&gt;getNumberFormat()-&gt;setFormatCode('@');</pre>\r\n<p>but that doesn't seem to work either. It seems like</p>\r\n<pre>$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getStyle($fieldName)-&gt;getNumberFormat()-&gt;setFormatCode('00000');</pre>\r\n<p>would be a good solution. But the length of the string can fluctuate (and this has to work for a client, who is tech illiterate). For example, there's a chance that when the client downloads the XLSX file, they'll want to change the string from a 5 digit to a 6 digit number, and then they'll blame me that the XLSX isn't letting them (if their number has leading zeros) ...</p>\r\n<p>I've been reading through the documentation, and I've searched the discussions, but I don't see a solution. Any ideas? I see that in Excel, the cell's formula is '00120 (with a leading '). Is this the solution? How do I do it?</p>\r\n<p>Cheers!</p>\r\n<p>Nick</p>",
