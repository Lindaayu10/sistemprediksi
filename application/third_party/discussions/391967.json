It works great.</p>\r\n<p>When I open the excel file I created on a hex editor I can see a extra byte between each character of the strings in my excel file.</p>\r\n<p>But if I open the same file I created with excel and resave it without editing, and then again open it using a hex editor those extra&nbsp;characters&nbsp;get disappear and I can see the&nbsp;continues string without extra byte between each&nbsp;character.</p>\r\n<p>My&nbsp;requirement&nbsp;is to generate the excel file without those extra&nbsp;characters between each char of the string directly from the library. (without open and re-save it using excel)</p>\r\n<p>Please help me.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank you.</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>PHPExcel always uses UTF-8 internally, and in saved files so that we're working with a standardised character set rather than the myriad of codepage sets that standard Excel works with. That's where those \"extra\"&nbsp;characters come from. If you want to get rid of them, then the file needs saving with the appropriate codepage, and not UTF-8. I'm afraid this is something that PHPExcel doesn't do, because of the complexities of converting everything between different codepages... the whole point of using a standard character set in the first place.</p>\r\n<p>Why does your file need to be byte exact? This is an extremely unusual requirement... if you do have a valid business reason for it, then I'd suggest your only option is to use COM</p>",
