Or at least there weren't any \"actual\" errors.  <br /><br />When I run 08conditionalformatting.php I am having some problems applying styles to some of the cells. Specifically:<br /><br />B2, B6 and B7 (which would use $objConditional2), the font is green, but the euro symbol is not applied.  <br /><br />Conversely, on cells B3:B5 (the cells using $objConditional1) <i>does</i> apply the euro symbol, however the $objConditional1-&gt;getStyle()-&gt;getFont()-&gt;getColor()-&gt;setARGB(PHPExcel<i>Style</i>Color::COLOR_RED); does not result in a red color format.<br /><br /><br />In addition, none of the cells are bold, though this line is present:  $objConditional1-&gt;getStyle()-&gt;getFont()-&gt;setBold(true); (there is an identical line for $objConditional2)<br />I have added the following to determine if there is a problem setting the bold, but no Exception is thrown<br />try<br />{<br />\t$objConditional1-&gt;getStyle()-&gt;getFont()-&gt;setBold(true);<br />}<br />catch(Exception $e) { print_r($e); }<br /><br /><br />I tried to search for something of this nature in the other posts, but could not find one.  Should I post this as a new thread or just leave it here?<br /><br />Again, I really appreciate all of your guys obvious hard work.  This class has amazing potential.<br />",

However, something seems odd with applying both of the conditions.  In the excel file, editing any of the numbers in B2:B6 will produce the following results:<br /><br />If the number is positive, or zero<br />{<br />     the font will be green, but no euro-symbol is present.  <br />} else {<br />     the euro-symbol will be present, but the font color (red in this case) will not be set<br />}<br /><br />Also, within Excel, going to:<br />     \"Conditional Formatting\" -&gt; \"Manage Rules\" -&gt; Show rules for \"This Worksheet\" <br />will only show the rules where \"Cell Value &gt;= 0\" -&gt; Green font<br />It appears there is no conditional format rule for $objConditional1 at all<br /><br />I hope this helps in some way...<br /><br />",

At the same time the GreaterThanOrEqual (green) condition will not work (though the euro-symbol then appears).<br /><br />Basically it looks like the second condition in the array_push is applied, while the other is not.  <br /><br />As a work around for this, I added the following:<br />$objConditional3 = new PHPExcel<i>Style</i>Conditional();  //nothing else was done to this object, it was just instanciated<br />//follow that line with these:<br />$conditionalStyles = $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getStyle('B2')-&gt;getConditionalStyles();<br />array_push($conditionalStyles, $objConditional3); //push the empty object first<br />array_push($conditionalStyles, $objConditional1);<br />array_push($conditionalStyles, $objConditional2);<br /><br />Doing this did in fact apply both of the conditions to the cells in need.  However, none of them have the applied euro-symbol.<br /><br />I hope that this can help you find this problem if in fact it is a bug.<br /><br /><br />I'll really try to stop posting until I hear back from someone...<br /><br /><br />Thanks a bunch for the help!<br />",
