I have set the formula for a cell as mentioned below:</p>\r\n<p>$objWorksheet-&gt;setCellValue('G19', '=&quot;Revenue &quot;&amp; ROUND(K20/J21*100,0)&amp;&quot;%&quot;');</p>\r\n<p>Now when I open the workbook, it is open in protected mode with an &quot;Enable Editing&quot; button displayed on top of the workbook in excel. And the value for G19 is displayed as follows:</p>\r\n<p>Revenue 7%</p>\r\n<p>When I click on the &quot;Enable Editing&quot; button to enable edit mode, the formula for the cell is displayed as &quot;Revenue &quot; only. All other cells in the workbook remain intact.</p>\r\n<p>Please let me know how to specify the formula when it has a combination of text and calculation so that it does not change in edit mode as well.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance,</p>\r\n<p>kdeepala</p>\r\n",

PHPExcel can correctly calculate the result of this formula, so the correct result is stored in the saved xls file; but the actual&nbsp;formula\r\n cannot be written correctly to the saved xls file. This includes the &amp; (concatenation) operator, which appears in your formula.</p>\r\n<p>There are two options available to you:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The latest SVN code does now support the &amp; operator within the Excel5 Writer,&nbsp;and you can download that from the &quot;Latest Version&quot; box to the right of the &quot;Source Code&quot; tab screen.\r\n</li><li>You can use the Excel CONCATENATE() function within your formula instead of the &amp; operator.\r\n</li></ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
