    "Html": "<p><span class=\"pBody postableBody\">I solved the problem! I gradually  removed pieces of the code to see if I could isolate what was causing  the problem. After getting down to almost nothing I tried removing the <br /><br />@session_start();<br /><br />line at the top of the page and that solved it. On other apps I had not used this and so the <span class=\"searchTerm\">PHPExcel</span> worked without a glitch, but on this one I had to access some $_SESSION  variables in the class. With a little research, I discovered that this  is a general problem with IE in accepting a <span class=\"searchTerm\">download</span> from PHP. The solution explanation can be found at:</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"pBody postableBody\"><a href=\"http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/2004/10/01/making-ie-accept-file-downloads/\" target=\"_blank\">http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/2004/10/01/making-ie-accept-file-<span class=\"searchTerm\">downloads</span>/</a></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"pBody postableBody\">The actual solution is to place this piece of code before calling the start of session:</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"pBody postableBody\">\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color: blue;\">if</span>(strpos($_SERVER[<span style=\"color: #a31515;\">'HTTP_USER_AGENT'</span>], <span style=\"color: #a31515;\">'MSIE'</span>)) {\r\n    session_cache_limiter(<span style=\"color: #a31515;\">\"public\"</span>);\r\n}\r\nsession_start();\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</span><span class=\"pBody postableBody\">The <span class=\"searchTerm\">download</span> works like a charm in IE now.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"pBody postableBody\"><br /></span></p>",
