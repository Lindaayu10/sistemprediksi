I used\r\n<strong>PHPExcel </strong>and it was working fine, but as records in the database increased i started to get\r\n<strong>internal server error</strong>. I checked and found that error was fired when the file was above\r\n<strong>50000 rows.</strong>Searched on google abt this problem but no solution found. It is not issue with memory limit or max execution time because in case of these problems i am getting proper error message like\r\n<strong>&quot;failed to allocate memory&quot;</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>If any body came across such problem plz reply..</p>\r\n<p>thanks in advance..</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>No, I guess not. The architecture of PHPExcel &nbsp;is batch oriented. First you create a PHPExcel object holding data in an intermediate format (either by using a reader, of by filling it by hand). Secondly the data is exported using a writer. This is, in my  opinion, one of the biggest problems when trying to handle large volumes of data. On the other hand, it gives the user a lot of flexibility in choosing in- and output options.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A great addition to phpexecl would be the possibility to use streaming input and output objects. However, I guess this would require the entire library to be rewritten.</p>",
