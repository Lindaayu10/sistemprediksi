Here is the Excel 2007 template, I am using: <a title=\"This is my Excel 2007 template\" href=\"http://www.sendspace.com/file/mozg3f\">http://www.sendspace.com/file/mozg3f</a>.<br>\r\nI set up the php.ini file to 600s (max_execution_time). The server is working on it and stops after about 90s and send me an empty file.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you know where it can come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks <br>\r\nLudo<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS: IMPORTANT -&gt; When there is less checks (from U55 to AF217), there is no problem.

This would rule out that there is some subtle MySQL setting preventing the script from working.\r\n",
