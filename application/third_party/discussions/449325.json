I am aware of the fact that PHPExcel will not handle these, and this is ok for my needs, as I would like to use it to update parts of the file which do not contain the external references.\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever, when trying to save the sheet and I re-open it, I will find &quot;Err!520&quot; instead of the external references.\r<br />\n<br />\nI'd just like to double check if the &quot;not handling&quot; the external references also implies losing the formulas, or if I am missing some step in the process.\r<br />\n<br />\nbelow is the code I am using\r<br />\n<br />\n&lt;?\r<br />\nrequire_once 'PHPExcel/Classes/PHPExcel.php';\r<br />\n$excel2 = PHPExcel_IOFactory::load('data/m2.xls');\r<br />\nPHPExcel_Calculation::getInstance()-&gt;disableCalculationCache();\r<br />\n$excel2-&gt;setActiveSheetIndexByName('Sheet1')  -&gt;setCellValue('C32', 'aaa');\r<br />\n$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($excel2, 'Excel5');\r<br />\n$objWriter-&gt;save('data/m2.xls');\r<br />\n?&gt;\r<br />\n<br />\nTIA for any feedback\r<br />\n<br />\nAndrea<br />\n",
