Indeed the script didn't seem to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat appears to be the problem is file corruption as a result of FTP ASCII mode transfer from Linux server to local Windows machine. This converts <code>\\n (0x0A)</code> to <code>\\r\\n (0x0D 0x0A)</code>in those OLE_PPS_File* files which is unfortunate. Can you try to grab those files again using FTP binary transfer mode and retry that script?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
