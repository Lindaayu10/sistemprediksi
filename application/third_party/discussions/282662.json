I am developing an app which requires on some cells that up to 5 conditional circumstances be checked for. The example has the lines:</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<pre>array_push($conditionalStyles, $objConditional1);\r\narray_push($conditionalStyles, $objConditional2);\r\n</pre>\r\nso I am assuming I can add more than two conditional rulesets and just add each with the array_push() function, but I have not seen any documentation to this effect. Is that how that would be done?\r\n<p></p>\r\n",
