Default encoding for russian letters is &quot;Windows-1251&quot; and Writer makes an error on such strings.</p>\r\n<p>That is why i cant write            setCellValue('A1', $MyString)</p>\r\n<p>and I always have to write                   setCellValue('A1', iconv('Windows-1251', 'UTF-8', $MyString))</p>\r\n<p>I think if  I can set this options in config file it will be much better.</p>\r\n<p>Smthing like this:</p>\r\n<p>PHPExcel.config.php:</p>\r\n<p>//Temp directory.  Comment this line to use system default directory</p>\r\n<p>$PHPEXCEL_TEMP_DIR = 'mydir';</p>\r\n<p>//User encodings</p>\r\n<p>$PHPEXCEL_USER_ENCODING = 'Windows-1251';</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n",

    "Html": "Ok, I see what you mean. Right now, PHPExcel does not support anything like a custom input encoding. I recall that this has been requested long time ago. Today we have the possibility in PHPExcel to define a custom value binder which is like a hook to the setValue() / setCellValue() method. It should be possible to use this to set an input user encoding. This would probably be the clean way of dealing with this. Will see if I can put together an example later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
