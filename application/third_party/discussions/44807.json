(Because this counts as echoing output)</li>\r\n    <li>Same things apply to all included files</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you think you are doing everything right, compare downloaded file with file saved on server disk. They should look the same in a HEX editor. Try to find out how they differ. Usually there is prepended or appended some stray characters (may even be just white space) because one or more of the above guidelines are violated.<br>\r\n",
