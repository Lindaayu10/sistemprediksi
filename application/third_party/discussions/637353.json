The problem is that there is <em>something</em> about the PHPExcel output that isn't quite exactly the same.  If I try to upload one of the files directly into our IT system, it will fail.  However, if I open the file in Excel and then immediately re-save it, it works perfectly?\r<br />\n<br />\nThe file looks identical to the naked eye, and even the file size being reported shows as the same.  But if I run an &quot;FC&quot; in Windows against the 2 files, it does identify some differences.<br />\n\r<br />\nShort of continuing to open/resave files, is there anything that can be done to adjust the output to a more &quot;true&quot; Excel file?  (and yes, I've already explored automating the open/resave... but I'd rather not have to if at all possible)<br />\n<pre><code>Comparing files C:\\USERS\\Me\\DESKTOP\\WKFILE\\test_no_resave.xls and C:\\USERS\\Me\\DESKTOP\\WKFILE\\TEST_WITH_RESAVE.XLS\n***** C:\\USERS\\Me\\DESKTOP\\WKFILE\\test_no_resave.xls\n\n€¤ZÐ¯ˆÐ\u0001@\n\n***** C:\\USERS\\Me\\DESKTOP\\WKFILE\\TEST_WITH_RESAVE.XLS\n\n€\u0012\\±¯ˆÐ\u0001@\n\n*****\n\n***** C:\\USERS\\Me\\DESKTOP\\WKFILE\\test_no_resave.xls\n\n€¤ZÐ¯ˆÐ\u0001\u0003\n\n***** C:\\USERS\\Me\\DESKTOP\\WKFILE\\TEST_WITH_RESAVE.XLS\n\n€\u0012\\±¯ˆÐ\u0001\u0003\n\n*****\n\n***** C:\\USERS\\Me\\DESKTOP\\WKFILE\\test_no_resave.xls\n\n;óÐ¯ˆÐ\u0001\n;óÐ¯ˆÐ\u0001\u0001\n\n***** C:\\USERS\\Me\\DESKTOP\\WKFILE\\TEST_WITH_RESAVE.XLS\n\n©ô±¯ˆÐ\u0001\n©ô±¯ˆÐ\u0001\u0001\n</code></pre>\n\n",
