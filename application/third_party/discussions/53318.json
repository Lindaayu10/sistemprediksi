I set column widths with the code below. <br>\r\n<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foreach ($tableProperties['width'] as $param =&gt; $value)<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getColumnDimension($param)-&gt;setWidth(($value+0.83));&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;//+0.83 == offset<br>\r\n</em><br>\r\nIt displays OK in Excel, but in PDF it displays very wider than it should be. I can send xls and pdf files on email. I just don't want to post screenshots with it's content on web. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it a known problem? Can you help me? It seems, that PDF's &quot;width&quot; is different from Excel one. It's about 2 times wider.<br>\r\n",
