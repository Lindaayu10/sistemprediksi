    "Html": "I have a script that generates a little xls table (~25x15). It contains percentages and strings and i have an if operator that sets the current cell as percentage type with this code:\r<br />\n<br />\n$this-&gt;objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getStyle($coords)-&gt;getNumberFormat()-&gt;setFormatCode('0.00%');\r<br />\n<br />\nBut when i export and look at the file I see it only managed to set type and style about 20 cells. And all the rest are with default settings. I debugged it and realized the problem isn't in my logic. I read about increasing php cache memory - tried it but it didn't work. Please help because i need to export at least 15 times larger table. Thanks in advance!<br />\n",

It may be that the problem is in a particular style that you are setting rather than after a number of styles.<br />\n",

Here is a sample code <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/wjWuX8J0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/wjWuX8J0</a> . When i uncomment cell-border settings export breaks, if i uncomment set-cell-to-percent functionality it breaks earlier. It seems the more styling and/or cell types i'm using the earlier export stops working. I'd be happy if you can give me any advice! Thanks in advance. \r<br />\n<br />\nP.S. (by stop working i mean it stops styling and setting cell types, but it manages to fill in the whole data).<br />\n",
