    "Html": "Hello.\r<br />\nI'm having a problem in one of xlsx file, that gives an error when I try to catch values of concrete cells.\r<br />\nFirst need to say that we have three different processes with PHPExcel and a spreadsheet in each of it. First and second works absoluty great, but third (which have a more complex spreadsheet, with tabs and lot of formulas, it's size is 700kb) is giving us a real pain.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe point is that I can write in spreadsheet I suppose all writed are ok (we haven't xmlwriter on server to test finnish document yet), but when I try to take values calculated with getCalculatedValue there are a number of cells that I cant retrieve it's value because throw this error:\r<br />\n<br />\nFatal error: Uncaught exception 'PHPExcel_Calculation_Exception' with message 'Consumos!FG6 -&gt; Consumos!FG6 -&gt; Consumos!FG6 -&gt; MaxIrrad!A4 -&gt; MaxIrrad!A4 -&gt; MaxIrrad!A4 -&gt; MaxIrrad!A4 -&gt; MaxIrrad!A4 -&gt; MaxIrrad!A4 -&gt; MaxIrrad!A4 -&gt; Consumos!FG6 -&gt; Consumos!FG6 -&gt; Consumos!FG6 -&gt; Consumos!FG6 -&gt; Invalid cell coordinate GH' in /var/www/html/clientes/generahogar/class/PHPExcel/Cell.php:300 \r<br />\n<br />\nThe error says that there are not GH column but really exists, and the whole calculation in Microsoft excel directly are not showing any error... \r<br />\nIt's interesting that this only happend when I try take some values, but another values (calculated with internal functions too) I can take it without problems, here some example of code:\r<br />\n<br />\n$result1 = $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getCell('AO22')-&gt;getCalculatedValue();\r<br />\n$result2 = $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getCell('AC38')-&gt;getCalculatedValue();\r<br />\n<br />\nIf I execute only result1, all are fine. But if want to get result2 too this cause error. This is a short example, I can take more than 1 value, the problem are happening in few cells that I need, 4 or 5 cells I think.\r<br />\n<br />\nI know this can be really concrete and difficult to fix for anybody that doesn't develop our project, but I wonder if it can be a more general problem that I guess and somebody can light my path, because I'm totally mired...\r<br />\n<br />\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks for your time\r<br />\nBest regards\r<br />\nAle<br />\n",
