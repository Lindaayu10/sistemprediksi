    "Html": "Thanks for the info, but I can not take the style/format from any part of the sheet. Users may have changed what is expected and excel seems to want to make stupid assumptions of its own.\r\n\r\nJust because data in the cell is  1-6 or 1/6 doesn't make it a date, some data is formatted this way for a reason other than a date.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the reasons we prefer to import CSV only, no BS like this. Unfortunately we send out a format for CSV, and get sent back a spreadsheet, that the user feels they need to &quot;pretty up&quot; and send back in proprietary formats that just have to be converted back to plain old text CSV.\r\n\r\nI then have to run it through a sanitation script to clean up all their &quot;pretty&quot; and spit back out a CSV.\r\n\r\nI just need to get all the cells of a column formatted the way I specify just like I highlighted the column, hit Format, Cells, Text.\r\n\r\n",
