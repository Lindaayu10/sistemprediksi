Of course, everything else is ok. But these lines seems don't work:<br />\n<pre><code>$this-&gt;_sheet-&gt;setCellValue('A6', 'Identificaci√≥n estructura Orange');\n$this-&gt;_sheet-&gt;mergeCells('A6:C6');\n$this-&gt;_sheet-&gt;getStyle(&quot;A6:C6&quot;)-&gt;applyFromArray(array('borders' =&gt; array('allborders' =&gt; array('style' =&gt; PHPExcel_Style_Border::BORDER_THIN))));\n $this-&gt;_sheet-&gt;getStyle('A6:C6')-&gt;getFill()-&gt;applyFromArray(array('type' =&gt; PHPExcel_Style_Fill::FILL_SOLID, 'startcolor' =&gt; array('rgb' =&gt; 'FF6600')));\n$this-&gt;_sheet-&gt;getStyle('A6:C6')-&gt;getAlignment()-&gt;setHorizontal(PHPExcel_Style_Alignment::HORIZONTAL_CENTER);</code></pre>\n\nI'm getting three empty cells, merged but without content nor border* nor fill color. *The top border only draws B and C cell but not A, but the right and the bottom bordes are ok...<br />\n <br />\nI don't find the problem, to me it looks well. I'll be very grateful for your help.<br />\nThank you very much.<br />\n",
