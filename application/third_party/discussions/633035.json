    "Html": "You have to manually set the row height to suit the image height (or perhaps a little larger).\r<br />\nFor example, I put images in a cell and set their height to 120, then I make the row height 130.\r<br />\nThis way the rows are still sortable. If the image is not completely within the cell, changing row order will cause the images to become orphaned from their parent cell, they will no longer be visually associated with the original row.\r<br />\nYou tell PHPExcel the height of the image when you load it so there should be no problem setting the row height similarly.<br />\n",
