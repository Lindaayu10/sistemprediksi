Or are there alternatives if any that could help show this chart.<br>\r\nIn example is it possible only to load the first sheet and alter it while the rest stays&nbsp;unchanged?</p>\r\n<p>I use PHPExcel 1.7.7&nbsp;with PHP&nbsp;5.3.3-7&#43;squeeze8&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks a lot in advance</p>\r\n",
