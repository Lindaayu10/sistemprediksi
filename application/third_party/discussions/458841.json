Now according to a post I found here, every cell takes about 1k memory, so 25,000 cells should take 25 megs of memory, when in reality I get this:<br />\n<br />\nOut of memory (allocated 351010816) (tried to allocate 72 bytes), that's 334 megs of memory it runs out of.<br />\n<br />\nNow it looks like it allocates memory for something way bigger than I'm using. Now I know there's a way to limit reading excel file, now what about writing, is there anything I can do about this?<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance,<br />\nDenis.<br />\n",
