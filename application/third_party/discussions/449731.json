    "Html": "Currently, I'm making a program for my job that uses PHPexcel to basically take all of the data from an excel sheet, make a new excel sheet and format it to text, and transfer all of the data from the old excel sheet.<br />\n<br />\nMy php has to be able to take in the values from the old excel sheet and parse them correctly, especially dates/numbers/etc.<br />\n<br />\nEverything is working fine except for the dates. For some reason when I get the formatted value of the cell; it does not match the date format in the first sheet. Specifically a value like this: 12/31/2099 . For some reason, it reads the formatcode incorrectly as mm-dd-yy and outputs 12-31-99. This is extremely frustrating and I've scoured half of the internet for an answer. Help please; I'm not sure what the issue is! Code:<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n$spreadSheet=$_FILES[&quot;filebrowser&quot;][&quot;tmp_name&quot;];\n/** PHPExcel_IOFactory */\nrequire_once 'Classes/PHPExcel/IOFactory.php';\nrequire_once 'Classes/PHPExcel/Shared/Date.php';\n$objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel2007');\n//Create temporary sheet from uploaded file data\n$objPHPExcel = $objReader-&gt;load($spreadSheet);\n$sheet = $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet();\n$sheet-&gt;setTitle(&quot;Original Data&quot;);\n$data=$sheet-&gt;getCell(&quot;D9&quot;)-&gt;getFormattedValue();\n\nvar_dump($data);\nexit;?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\nD9 is a cell with DATE format and a value of 12/31/2099. This code prints 12-31-99...<br />\nI also cannot explicitly define the format string, this is because the user can enter different types of formats mm-dd-yyyy, mm/dd/yyyy, m-d-Y, etc. I really need some help here, so any at all is very much appreciated.<br />\n",
