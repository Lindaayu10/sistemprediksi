    "Html": "To get leading zeros you proceed the same way as you do in MS Office Excel. <br>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Type the value in the cell, e.g 53</li>\r\n    <li>Apply custom number format 0000 (example: <a href=\"http://img237.imageshack.us/img237/988/formatkk5.png\">http://img237.imageshack.us/img237/988/formatkk5.png</a>)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nNote that in MS Office Excel it does not help to type e.g. 0053. As soon as you press enter, the leading zeros are cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn PHPExcel, the above corresponds to this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n$cell = $ws-&gt;getCell('A1');<br>\r\n$cell-&gt;setValue('53');<br>\r\n//$cell-&gt;setValue(53); // this would work too<br>\r\n$ws-&gt;getStyle('A1')-&gt;getNumberFormat()-&gt;setFormatCode('0000');<br>\r\n// displayed in cell as: 0053<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think one should not try to change data type to string if the values are numbers from a semantic viewpoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a side remark, number formatting is really confusing in MS Office Excel because here one has labeled one number format &quot;Text&quot;. But it does not change data type. Internally, data type stays as a number. It just shifts the number to the left.<br>\r\n",
