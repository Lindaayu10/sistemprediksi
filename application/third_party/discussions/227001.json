The PDF Writer uses the HTML Writer to generate HTML first, and then converts that to PDF. However, we don't generate HTML from XLS, but from the PHPExcel object. When you read an XLS file, you're extracting data from that file to create the PHPExcel object; so technically it's XLS-$objPHPExcel for the Reader, followed by $objPHPExcel-HTML-PDF for the Writer.</p>\r\n<p>The PDF Writer current supports paper size and alignment, but I'd certainly like to get it working with headers and footers, and both that and the HTML Writer working with page breaks.</p>",
