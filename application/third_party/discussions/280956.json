The load() method extracts each file from the ziparchive in turn, calling the _getFromZipArchive() for each constituent file that it needs. All the processing of the files is handled from within _load().... it is one large method (and not particularly good OO coding). SImpleXML is used for parsing these files: someday, I'll rewrite to use the XMLReader which will be more memory efficient for the load.</p>",

There's a section in the documentation that describes the cache methods available - <a href=\"http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/discussions/234150\">this thread </a>gives some indication of the relative benefits/costs of the different caching methods. And <a href=\"http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/discussions/242712?ProjectName=phpexcel\">this thread </a>describes some of the other techniques available to reduce memory usage.</p>",
