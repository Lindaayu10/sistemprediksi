As I have regional settings in my PC as Dutch (NetherLand). I want this numeric value to be displaeyd as &quot;1.070,594&quot; in the excel sheet.</p>\r\n<p>I tried with changing the number format and i got the &quot;1.070,594&quot; value displayed in the excel sheet. But this value is saved as text. So i cant apply formulas like =sum() on this.</p>\r\n<p>When i tried without applying number format and then exported the excel, I could apply the formulas in the excel sheet. But value is displayed as &quot;1070.594&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>So is it possible to <strong>display numeric value as &quot;1.070,594&quot; (Dutch netherland regional settings) and apply the formulas in the exported excel sheet</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Are these both things achievable at a time with PhpExcel??</p>\r\n<p>Please help.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
