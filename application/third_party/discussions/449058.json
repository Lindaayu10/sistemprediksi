In my local server everything worked fine, but the problem was when I tested it in a remote server.<br />\nAfter execution, in local server I get full message on screen: PHPExcel_Shared_String CI_ExcelMY_ExcelPHP.... but in remote server, there's something missing at the end of the string: &quot;PHPExcel_Worksheet_AutoFilter_ColumnPHPExcel_Calculation_Token_Stack&quot; doesn't appear. <br />\n<br />\nBy the way, local server works with php5.3.3 and remote server with php5.3.10<br />\nI would appreciate any help.<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",
