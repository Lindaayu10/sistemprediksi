That indicates that the method is not faster, but maybe just helps reducing memory consumption... which is of course also good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe need to improve performance in PHPExcel. This is probably not easy, but I feel it's coming closer now that many of the critical bugs have been eliminated. There may be nothing simple you can do right now to speed up your script... unfortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
