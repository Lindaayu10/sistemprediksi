I also want to be able to output to PDF as well, so I've got a simple switch at the bottom of the page stating:\r\n<pre>if ($_GET['file_format'] == 'pdf') {<br>\t// Save PDF file<br>\t$objWriter = new PHPExcel_Writer_PDF($objPHPExcel);<br>\t$objWriter-&gt;save(str_replace('.php', '.pdf', __FILE__));<br><br>\t// Rename and Move File<br>\trename( 'agent_statement.pdf', '../archive/'.$new_filename.'.pdf' );<br>} else {<br>\t// Save Excel 2007 file<br>\t$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel2007');<br>\t$objWriter-&gt;save(str_replace('.php', '.xlsx', __FILE__));<br><br>\t// Rename nad Move File<br>\trename( 'agent_statement.xlsx', '../archive/'.$new_filename.'.xlsx' );<br>}</pre>\r\nIt creates the PDF, but the formatting is all wrong. Images are missing, row heights and widths are incorrect, information off the side of the pages, etc. Is there something I am doing wrong, or do I need to have a page styled for PDF and another for XLSX?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTa<br>\r\nIan<br>\r\n",

Maybe you have a similar situation. There is a chance that you can get around the problems by setting explicit heights for the problematic cells, but I'm not sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
