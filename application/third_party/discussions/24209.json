At least when I open the file with Excel2000. <br /><br />According to documentation, PHPExcel<i>Writer</i>Excel5 \"is basically a modified version of PEAR Spreadsheet<i>Excel</i>Writer, and has the same limitations and features as the PEAR library\". According to PEAR Manual, Spreadsheet<i>Excel</i>Writer has Worksheet::printArea method implemented.<br /><br />Does it mean that PHPExcel<i>Writer</i>Excel5 should support setting printing area?<br /><br />setScale, setFitToHeight and setFitToWidth do not seem to work too.<br />",
