    "Html": "<p>Hello,</p>\r\n<p>I have users who need to upload .csv files to a web app I've developed. They inevitable are not saving their Excel files correctly to .csv. In order to improve their experience I wanted to allow them to simply upload their .xls files and do the conversion myself with PHPExcel. Can someone point me in the right direction to get this accomplished? This seems like a very useful tool, but it is somewhat intimidating getting started with it. Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>",
