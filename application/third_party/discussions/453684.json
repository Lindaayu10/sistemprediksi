    "Html": "Hello,\r<br />\n<br />\nI've recently been working with PHPExcel (version 1.7.9) to generate some reports from a template. Said template includes a few charts. So far, everything works fine save for one detail. The scale for the Y-axis is automatically assigned by PHPExcel based on the data, and I'd like it to be fixed (it's a 1 to 5 scale, but if the data being charted doesn't reach 5, the maximum defaults to the one on the data).\r<br />\n<br />\nSo I have two questions, after a lot of searching:\r<br />\n1) I understand that fixed scale charts are not supported by PHPExcel yet. Is this correct?\r<br />\n<br />\n2) Is there a way to circumvent this limitation, perhaps by defining the scale myself for the chart through the code?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks beforehand.<br />\n",

The data doesn't start to 0 if no 0 value are in the series.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe last solution is to modify the Excel file to change manually the scaled minimum and maximum, not a real  good use :( \r<br />\n<br />\nThank's a lot for answer.<br />\n",
