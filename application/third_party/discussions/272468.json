When users try to upload file protected sheets it php excel generates thousands of notices and crashes php (due to memory), one user reported this issue (http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/discussions/50720)\r\n but I'm not as interested in solving the notices as I am detecting if a file is password protected. The end goal being telling the user &quot;Hey you can't user password protected files&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My question being, is there an easy way to detect if a file is password protected so that I can defensively code against a crash? If it's fairly simple, I wouldn't mind getting my hands dirty with the code, if I could be pointed in the right direction.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Protection is done at workbook level (users can't add/remove worksheets) and at worksheet level (users can't change sheet structure, add/remove lines/columns, able only to fill cell not locked). These files are used as templates to enter data that is later on loaded into a database.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks a lot :)</p>",
