The default behaviour (if it does not match any of the recognised\r\n file types) is to treat it as a CSV file, and use the CSV Reader, which explains why you are getting content like &quot;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Number&lt;/td&gt;...............&quot; in the cells.</p>\r\n<p>PHPExcel does not currently have an HTML Reader (I have done some work on this, but it isn't yet accurate enough to include in the library).</p>\r\n",
