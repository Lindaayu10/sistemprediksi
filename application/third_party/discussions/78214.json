    "Html": "<p>The problem is that TCPDF (which PHPExcel uses) has incomplete support for borders in HTML mode. We are still waiting for the situation to change.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, you can try to play with <a href=\"http://mpdf.bpm1.com/\">mPDF</a> which has better support for borders. If you first export to HTML with inline CSS using PHPExcel, you can afterwards send the generated HTML to mPDF that can generate the final PDF. It may require some experiments.</p>",
