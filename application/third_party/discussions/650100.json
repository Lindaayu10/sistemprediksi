I am just learning how to use this and have been able to populate a blank spread sheet with a mysql query, works great.  Now what I would like to do is to take a spreadsheet that is formatted and saved and populate that with data from a query.  I'm using  $objPHPExcel = new PHPExcel() ; to create the new spreadsheet and  $objPHPExcel-&gt;setActiveSheetIndex(0) and  $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet() to populate the spreadsheet on my first project.  for my new project how would I call a saved spreadsheet so that I can populate it with data?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for any help.  Let me know if you need more information.<br />\n",
