I would love to somehow used automatic width, and be able to\r\n specify a minimum width (maybe even based on the content for those merged cells) for a range of rows.</p>\r\n<p>It's hard to explain, but currently I have some PHP doing calculations on string length in order to dynamically set widths to&nbsp;accommodate&nbsp;a 'minimum width' in order to keep all text in merged cells visible while making cells that are not merged\r\n collapse over/under those troublesome merged cells.</p>\r\n<p>Basically it extends the right most column to take up the slack, allowing the merged cell to be completely visible, but also aligning non-merged cells properly.</p>\r\n<p>If I'm making any sense, I was hoping someone out there has some PHPExcel magic that might make my life a little easier?</p>\r\n",
