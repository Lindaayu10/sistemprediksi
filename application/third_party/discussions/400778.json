It leads to just &quot;D&quot; in the excel cell.</p>\r\n<p>I tried &quot;De&amp;acutepenses&quot; but it does not work. Is there something to add into the header() command ?</p>\r\n<p>I also tried to add</p>\r\n<p><em>header('Content-Type: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet;\r\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000\">charset=iso-8859-1'</span>);</em></p>\r\n<p>before calling the createWriter function. It does not work either.</p>\r\n<p>thanks</p>\r\n",
