    "Html": "\r\n<p>Perhaps not the best answer to give, but &quot;probably&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>PHPExcel uses a third-party library to actually build the PDF. What we do is build an HTML string (using the same basic output as the HTML Writer), and then feed that string to the tcPDF library that is bundled with PHPExcel.</p>\r\n<p>tcPDF has a few problems... particularly with rendering cell borders correctly. It is also incredibly slow to build the PDF from HTML, and can't handle larger worksheets without using very large amounts of memory. I've been looking at a few alternatives,\r\n such as DomPDF and mPDF to perform the same function, but each has its pros and cons.</p>\r\n<p><strong>tcPDF</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pros<br>\r\nNo observed problems with any UTF-8 characters<br>\r\nSupports Document Information properties </li><li>Cons<br>\r\nProblems with borders, especially with merged cells<br>\r\nDisplays thick grid around non-null cells when setShowGridLines(true)<br>\r\nDisplays incredibly thick grid around all cells when setShowGridLines(false)<br>\r\nSuperscript/Subscript appear out of place wrt the cell borders<br>\r\nSlow </li><li>Typical Performance<br>\r\nCall time to save Worksheet 1 to PDF file was 23.6305 seconds<br>\r\nMemory usage: 29.25 MB </li><li>Output file size is 894 KB </li></ul>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<strong>DomPDF</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pros<br>\r\nHandles borders cleanly, even for merged cells<br>\r\nDisplays Superscript/Subscript correctly </li><li>Cons<br>\r\nMisses the first row to be displayed on each page<br>\r\nRequires PHP v5.2.9, otherwise it doesn't page correctly, but latest beta overwrites the first page with all subsequent pages<br>\r\nLatest fixes (post) generates an addition blank page on every page break<br>\r\nCan't display some UTF-8 characters<br>\r\nTop Margin settings on 2nd and subsequent pages are ignored (suspect problem will be replicated with bottom margins on all but the last page)<br>\r\nDisplays grid only around null cells when setShowGridLines(true)<br>\r\nNo support for Document Information properties </li><li>Typical Performance<br>\r\nCall time to save Worksheet 1 to PDF file was 16.6204 seconds<br>\r\nMemory usage: 42.25 MB </li><li>Output file size is 13 KB </li></ul>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<strong>mPDF</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pros<br>\r\nHandles borders cleanly, even for merged cells<br>\r\nCorrectly displays grid around all cells when setShowGridLines(true); no problems when setShowGridLines(false)<br>\r\nNo problems with any UTF-8 characters<br>\r\nSupports Document Information properties </li><li>Cons<br>\r\nGPLv2<br>\r\nMemory-hungry<br>\r\nProblems with subscripted text (can't see it in resultant PDF) </li><li>Typical Performance<br>\r\nCall time to save Worksheet 1 to PDF file was 14.3668 seconds<br>\r\nMemory usage: 69.25 MB </li><li>Output file size is 74 KB </li></ul>\r\n<p>None of the three works well with large worksheets.</p>\r\n<p>mPDF is the best overall, fast and with very clean output (I might even be able to improve on the high memory usage): apart from the license issues, which conflicts with&nbsp;PHPExcel's LGPL license. I may have a word with the developers and see if they're\r\n willing to allow us to include it in our distribution under LGPL, but I'm not sure they would.</p>\r\n<p>An alternative is for me to drop the actual PDF library itself from the distribution; and just provide wrappers for a number of the more popular libraries, so that you could use your own preferred PDF library, selecting it&nbsp;via PHPExcel_Settings before\r\n using the PDF Writer. One major benefit of this would be a drop in the size of the distribution. The PHPExcel classes directory and subdirectories take up about 19.6MB on disk, of which 16.8MB is tcPDF. (DomPDF needs 9.14MB and mPDF needs a mammoth 29.9MB).</p>\r\n<p>If anybody is aware of any other PDF libraries that can render from HTML input, I'd be interested to know so that it could run comparative tests to see if there is anything better suited for rendering worksheets.</p>\r\n",
