Having this versatile tool I'm now thinking of massproducing pivot tables. <br />The problem for me is I'm a total Excel ignorant. Before I start to dig into this myself, I would appreciate if someone can tell if it is possible to produce 'Excel pivot tables' with this softeware and publish a simple example how to do pivot tables. <br />",
