(styling, etc does not matter)<br />I also might need to convert rather large files (up to about 40 MB), but a 2MB XLSX file needs more than 200MB of memory.<br />Is there possibly a way to read an XLSX file line by line in order to keep the memory usage down?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Andy<br />",

By running that first I was able to load the 2 MB file, but I was still not able to load a 7.5 MB xlsx file.<br />I tried using some of the writers, such as html and csv, and found that csv would be best for me. I was able to convert all of the<br />xlsx files in the source code, but not my 2MB or 7.5 MB file. I was looking at the data structure for the cellCollection. It looked like there<br />is a lot of overhead when it comes to borders, margins, and fonts, etc. Would there be an easy way to disregard all of the styling, and<br />only load the values for each cell?<br />",
