I've read here for hours but could not find a similar problem or a solution.</p>\r\n<p>1. Local machine (XAMPP, PHP 5.2.9) all working fine. Excel5 and Excel2007 import and export all working. Files can be opened or downloaded. No problems at all.</p>\r\n<p>2. Live site (PHP 5.2.4-2ubuntu5.12 with php_zip enabled). Excel5 works without any problems, Excel2007 can only be imported, export does not work.</p>\r\n<p>I do not get error messages and my server log does not contain messages. Firebug doesn't help either. The fact that I can open Excel2007 files tells me that phpzip is fully working and that the rest of the setup seems to be OK.</p>\r\n<p>Does anyone here have an idea or ran into a similar problem? If yes, any help would be appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you</p>\r\n<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention that the test script did not run either due to a rights setting. I could correct that.</p>\r\n<p>Question: where does the Excel2007 writer create the temporary ZIP file??</p>\r\n",

And it works!</p>\r\n<p>What I've not found out yet is how to determine the path for the temp file, because I don't like where it is strored now - under Joomlaroot/administrator.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you anyway and keep up the good work.</p>\r\n",
