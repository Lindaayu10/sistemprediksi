I have an excel file with field 'Description(May be more than 1000 characters in each cell)' including 248 rows right now. When i try to insert it into database table insert then first 92 lines executed into database. Can you assist me regard this matter why phpExcel is limiting this. In near future may be excel rows should be more than 50000. Please tell me how can i handle large files data. Thanks&nbsp;</p>",

Each excel cell is heavy therefore i need proper method which will deal with html. Is there any function or method in phpexcel that will handle this html cell data and take it from excel and insert into database from start to end? If yes please give me at least one example. Thanks&nbsp;</p>",
