    "Html": "I have a table, which is sorted out by <code>item_code</code> and <code>status</code>. I have 3 statuses = 0,1 and 2. I want to make some calculations when each status is finished.\r<br />\n<br />\nBasically, PXPExcel overwrites the last row of each <code>status</code> category. According to the database there is: 4 rows with <code>status 0</code>, 1 row with <code>status 1</code> and 5 rows with <code>status 2</code>. I'm stuck on this part already for couple of days, so any help would be appreciated. \r<br />\n \r<br />\nHere is my code:\r<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://pastebin.com/4FZjZmt4\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/4FZjZmt4</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nHere is the export file output:\r<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/xR5nP3Q\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/xR5nP3Q</a>\r<br />\n <br />\nWhat I've already tried to do: <br />\n<pre><code>   /*\n    *   Add +1 to each count so it could count last row as well.\n    *       1. Start adding +1 to each count outside the main loop.\n    *       2. $newCountOne = $countZero + ($countOne +1);\n    *       3. $newCountTwo = $newCountOne + ($countTwo +1);\n    *       4. if ( $loopCounter == ($countZero +1 ) )\n    *       5. To raise $key parameter in &quot;total&quot; row.\n    *\n    */\n\n</code></pre>\n\nAfter asking question on SO, I managed to ugrade my code and it's look like this now, but it still not working as I expected.\r<br />\n<br />\nThis is how it's looks now - <a href=\"http://imgur.com/TTw1KIp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/TTw1KIp</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nNew code - <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/1HC5rgf7\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/1HC5rgf7</a> <br />\n",
