    "Html": "Hello,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm using PHPExcel to create a little report for myself, and I've been experiencing some trouble. When I generated the file, everything goes well, untill I try to open the file. When I open it, Excel says unreadable content has been encountered and the only way to open it is to &quot;repair&quot; it. Apparently, there's something wrong in the &quot;xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml&quot; file, because that's where it says it encountered the error. I've opened the file with a zip-archiver, and I found out that this was always the / at the end of the &lt;pageMargins&gt; tag in the sheet1.xml file.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm kindof at a loss here, I've tried all sorts of things but it just keeps on popping up that error. Even if I just create a PHPExcel-object and then just write to a file. I've got other scripts working with PHPExcel just fine, this is the only one that's causing trouble for me. Can anyone help me with this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm using Excel 2007 on Windows Vista 64-bit at home, and the server is running Apache 1.3.37 and PHP 5.2.3. I'm using PHPExcel 1.6.2, I could supply you with more info when asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreetings,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatriot<br>\r\n",
