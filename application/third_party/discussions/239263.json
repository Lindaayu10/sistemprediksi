    "Html": "\r\n<p>Without seeing the actual file output, it's difficult to say whether it is corrupted in any way. An Excel xls file is a binary document, which means that it's full of &quot;strange symbols&quot;... open any normal xls file to see what I mean. Likewise, an Excel xlsx\r\n file is zip compressed, so again it contains what appear to be &quot;strange symbols&quot;. For an xlsx file, you can try unzipping it to see the actual content. However, as I said, without seeing the actual generated file, it's impossible to say if the &quot;strange symbols&quot;\r\n are valid, or are a corruption.</p>\r\n",
