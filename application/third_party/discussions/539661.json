Now i'm triyng to make some charts; when i know de number of columns and rows of the data, it works great; i now need to make a script for making some charts, but i don't know in advance the amount o columns and rows; i have two variables; $cantColumnas and $cantFilas, so i can make a for loop in order to scan both rows and columns, but when i try to implement <strong>PHPExcel_Chart_DataSeriesValues</strong>, for labels and data, i canÂ´t make it to work! Any suggestions?<br />\n",
