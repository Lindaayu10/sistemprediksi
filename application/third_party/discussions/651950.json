Other than the occasional failure to evaluate certain functions, it's working great.\r<br />\n<br />\nHaving said that, what is the future of PHPExcel? I notice the last release was about two years ago. Is there any current/future development planned? \r<br />\n<br />\nI ask because I used to use a different product to read Excel spreadsheets, but the devs abandoned it and it doesn't work with newer spreadsheet versions. It essentially died and I had to rework all of my code that deals with spreadsheets.<br />\n",
