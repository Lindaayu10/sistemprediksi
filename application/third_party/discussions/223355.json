Some time ago I had post an error when up and run an application on the  server, since Local mode works without problems. This error is  associated with the number of discussions 74 737 (Error When recording  in a format with formulas, styles and graphics), specifically on May 14  at 24:05.  The detail is that I was told that the problem had already been resolved  (pkhera user), however most did not see the solution, and even lowering  the latest version of the library, thinking I had the fix, the problem  persists.  If someone could tell me corrections that I do to solve the problem  really appreciate it because I had to link multiple excel sheets, being  able to do directly with the library, brought me several problems with  data and formulas that there is contemplating , which I address each  time they use the program.  On the other hand, do not think it necessary to say that this will also  benefit me, the users of this library, coupled with the fact that this  entails feedback for everyone.</p>",
