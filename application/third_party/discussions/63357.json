Will be fixed in tomorrows source code release.<br> <br> <em>Some remarks:</em><br> <br> 1.</p>\r\n<p>It is intentional in PHPExcel 1.7.0 that Calibri 11 is used as the default font for (row/column labels and cells) for both the Excel2007 and Excel5 writer. In PHPExcel 1.6.7 Arial 10 was used by Excel5 writer and Calibri 10 was used by Excel2007 writer.<br> <br> 2.</p>\r\n<p>Another change in PHPExcel 1.7.0 compared to 1.6.7 is the default font (used for row/column lables and cells).<br> <br> In PHPExcel 1.7.0 you set the default font like this:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>$workbook-&gt;getDefaultStyle()-&gt;getFont()-&gt;setName(<span style=\"color:#A31515\">'Arial'</span>);\r\n$workbook-&gt;getDefaultStyle()-&gt;getFont()-&gt;setSize(10);\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In MS Office Excel 2007, this corresponds to <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">Excel Options &gt; Popular &gt; When creating new workbooks &gt; Use this font</span><br> <a href=\"http://www.learnthat.com/software/learn/1160/Microsoft_Excel_2007_Tutorial/page/6/\">http://www.learnthat.com/software/learn/1160/Microsoft_Excel_2007_Tutorial/page/6/</a><br> <br> In PHPExcel 1.6.7 there was a default style for each sheet. This concept has been dropped in PHPExcel 1.7.0. The reason for this is that the Excel file format does not support such a default sheet style and it was giving problems during further development of the library. In PHPExcel 1.7.0, when you try to set the default style for any sheet, it will be set for the entire workbook. (Therefore, I suggest that you update your code as shown above)</p>\r\n<p>3.</p>\r\n<p>When you generate Excel files from a template (xls or xlsx) using PHPExcel, default font should of course survive. That means if you for example read an xls template that has Verdana 20 as default workbook font, it will still have that default font after a plain read/write.</p>",
