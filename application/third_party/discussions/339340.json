I sized the the height of the image such that the width of the image spans exactly the columns I'm using (through trial-and-error). It looks great in excel, except\r\n that these are quote spreadsheets that will be exported to pdf using excel's built-in ability. When I do that, the image in the resulting pdf is smaller. Here is the relevant code:</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>$objDrawing = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> PHPExcel_Worksheet_Drawing();\r\n$objDrawing-&gt;setName(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'Quote_Header'</span>);\r\n$objDrawing-&gt;setDescription(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'Quote_Header'</span>);\r\n$objDrawing-&gt;setPath(<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'/var/www/img/grey_header.png'</span>);\r\n$objDrawing-&gt;setHeight(151);\r\n$objDrawing-&gt;setWorksheet($objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet());\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>If it would help, I'll see if I can get some screenshots up. The upper-left corner of the image is correct in both formats, but the lower right is significantly different (as if the image was scaled down).</p>\r\n<p>I suspect it has to do with specifying pixels per inch or something similar. It doesn't happen with a native Excel 2007 doc.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance for any insight.</p>\r\n",
