The cellborders/cellspacing was the only way I could resolve some of the problems with borders\r\n manifested in earlier versions.</p>\r\n<p>I am disappointed with tcPDF though. While it allows us to generate reasonable PDF output, it's extremely slow and memory hungry and the code is even larger than the core PHPExcel code, plus there's a lot of functionality that it can't handle (e.g. more\r\n columns than will fit on a page). I've decided to take a look at some of the alternatives to tcPDF, to see if they can do the job better and more efficiently.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
