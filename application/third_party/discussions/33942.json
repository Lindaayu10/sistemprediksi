The\r\nrequirements of the PHPExcel 1.6.2 library is to have PHP Version 5.2.5 or\r\nhigher and I would like to know if any of the past releases would work with PHP\r\nVersion 5.1.6. (I couldn't find this information in the project web page.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have managed to create some excel files in my PHP 5.1.6 box (with some issues but the file can be read by Excel anyways) but in others tries I haven't be able to create a compatible file. So I can assume that some of the functions work with 5.1.6 but not all of them. Does someone knows which ones ?<br>\r\n",
