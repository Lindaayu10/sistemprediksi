    "Html": "OK, here it goes... (Part I)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI generated *.xlsx file with image using excel writer Excel2007. Image was blurry (as usual). Then I inserted the same image again by hand using Excel. So in my *.xlsx document i had 1 blurry image and 1 normal image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen i changed *.xlsx file extension to *.zip, opened it and tried to search for images. The only image i found was in <strong>archive.zip\\xl\\media</strong> folder. It was in its original quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, i made a copy of the archive and opened it with excel, removed blurry image and checked <strong>archive.zip\\xl\\media</strong> folder again. Image was there.<br>\r\nI made another copy of the archive and opened it with excel, removed newly inserted image (not blurry one) and checked <strong>archive.zip\\xl\\media</strong> folder again. Image was there.<br>\r\nThen I made another copy of the archive and opened it with excel, removed both images and checked <strong>archive.zip\\xl\\media</strong> folder again. There were no images.<br>\r\n<em>Conclusion</em>: &quot;blurrisity&quot; was not the image's quality's fault, as the excel use the same normal quality image differently in the excel file. It is the excel, which was somehow instructed to show blurry image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere we go again.... (Part II)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only place where the name of the image was mentioned is the <strong>archive.zip\\xl\\drawings\\_rels\\drawing1.xml.rels</strong> file. Name of the image was assigned to some &quot;relationship&quot; variable there. &quot;Relationship&quot; variable's name was <em>rId1.</em><br>\r\nSo then i looked for a places where<em> rId1 </em>was mentioned in. Found two places, both in the same file <strong>archive.zip\\xl\\drawings\\drawing1.xml</strong>.<br>\r\nThen, by comparing found two nodes of code, i noticed, that by commenting &lt;a:scene3d&gt;...&lt;/a:scene3d&gt; section, blurry image become normal again :).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, i tried to comment those &lt;a:scene3d&gt; tags generating code and it worked fine then. Not sure what theese tags do, but i like my excel documents better without them ;). It were lines <strong>266-287</strong> in <strong>PHPExcel/Writer/Excel2007/Drawing.php</strong> file. PHPExcel version 1.6.2. Starting line text: <em>$objWriter-&gt;startElement('a:scene3d');</em><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDont know how to fix this in excel writer Excel5, but FlexIDX's project should be fine with this.. same as the mine ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
