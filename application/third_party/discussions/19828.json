This usually is a very long text and when I add this with getActiveSheet()-&gt;setCellValue I get only a part of the entire text ( I tried to count how many chars it writes, but my excel doesn't recognize the LEN function... maybe you can help me with this issue as well.. ) . So, what do I have to do to write the entire 'description' product field inside the cell?<br />Thank you for help.<br />Bye!<br /><br />",
