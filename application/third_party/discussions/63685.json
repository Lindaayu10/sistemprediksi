    "Html": "<p>[file received]<br> <br> Indeed the problem was that memory was exhausted. If you open the defect xlsx file in a text editor you will see just this:<br>\r\n<pre>\r\n<strong>Fatal error</strong>:  Allowed memory size of 41943040 bytes exhausted\r\n(tried to allocate 40 bytes) in <strong>/usr/share/pear/PHPExcel/Style/Fill.php</strong>\r\non line <strong>356</strong><br>\r\n</pre>\r\nSo the Excel file should have been redirected to the client browser, but PHP memory was exhausted.<br> <br> <strong>Tip 1:</strong><br> It looks like PHP memory limit is 40MB. Try to increase by adding at the beginning of your script:<br>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>ini_set(<span style=\"color:#A31515\">'memory_limit'</span>, <span style=\"color:#A31515\">'128M'</span>);\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\nThis may or may not work depending whether your web hosting has put memory limit restrictions via Apache. There is usually some kind of restriction.<br> <br> <strong>Tip 2:</strong><br> Download latest source code and test again. In many cases it will use less memory.<br> <a href=\"../SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx\">http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx</a></p>",
