(The particular resulting spreadsheet is essential y a financial breakdown.)</p>\r\n<p>On output all the relevant cells appeared blank.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;I removed the &lsquo;&pound;&rsquo; symbol and the numeric value was subsequently displayed. Firstly it was incorrect to use numbers VARCHAR field and have changed accordingly.</p>\r\n<p>All changes now work.</p>\r\n<p>However, in a field set as VARCHAR which is for &lsquo;user notes&rsquo; I found that if the user enter the &lsquo;&pound;&rsquo; symbol it will truncate the remainder of the text thereafter.</p>\r\n<p>I am probably missing the obvious but any ideas pointing me in the right direction would be most appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\r\n",
