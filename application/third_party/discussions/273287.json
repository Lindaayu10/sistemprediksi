But after saving file in Excel5 format using PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5, the output spreadsheet contains cell with truncated\r\n formula like &quot;=A2*50%&quot;. In other words, saving removes all characters after % symbol. Saving for Excel2007 is OK for this case.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe it is bug in Excel5 Writer or exist another solution? Thanks.</p>\r\n",
