I'm pretty sure that Open Office uses 0 and 1 like Excel itself, but this seems to be one of the ways in which Libre Office has changed the way it saves as xlsx.</p>\r\n<p>I'm not sure why \"false\" is being treated as a boolean TRUE; but knowing the problem, I can fix it. It will take a while to work through all boolean attributes and settings in the Excel 2007 reader code changing them in such a way that either the word or the numeric will be evaluated correctly; but I'll try and make sure that it's completed before the 1.7.9 release (which should be sometime around New Year).</p>",
