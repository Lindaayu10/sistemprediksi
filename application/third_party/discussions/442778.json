It works great but now the accountant want's to have the invoice column to be a date instead of a string.<br />\n<br />\nI managed that by using the following code:<br />\n<br />\n$data[2] is a php timestamp.<br />\n$x is the current row.<br />\n<br />\n$objPHPExcel-&gt;setActiveSheetIndex(0)-&gt;setCellValue('C'.$x, \\PHPExcel_Shared_Date::PHPToExcel($data[2]));<br />\n$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getStyle('C'.$x)-&gt;getNumberFormat()-&gt;setFormatCode('dd-mm-yyyy');<br />\n<br />\nThe first 25 columns are going great but after the 25th the value in the cell transforms to a decimal number. (See the image beneath)<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://www.eventgoose.nl/media/phpexcel.png\" alt=\"Image\" /><br />\n<br />\nI'm wondering what the source of this problem is and what is the solution?<br />\n<br />\nI think that the cell properties aren't set properly. Any suggestions on fixing this?<br />\n",
