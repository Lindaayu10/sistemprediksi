I tried running the 01sample.php file from the Tests folder, without modifying anything, got no error, the 01sample.xlsx file was generated, 7kb, so some content was written, but when I try to open, i get a corrupt file message: &quot;Excel found unreadable content..you want to save contents of workbook? Yes/No and clicking on Yes only throws a message that file is corrupt&quot;. I uploaded the 01sample.xlsx file if anyone thinks it might help. I also asked a different&nbsp;colleague&nbsp;that has office2007 to open same file and got the same error so I'm guessing it's not my office installation.</p>\r\n<p>Excel file generated: http://rapidshare.com/files/356069367/01simple.xlsx</p>\r\n<p>Anyone knows what might cause this?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",
