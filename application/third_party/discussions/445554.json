    "Html": "Hi\r<br />\n<br />\nI am using PHPExcel and am trying to write some code to take an Excel Spreadsheet and produce some PHP code from it that represents the fields and drop-down lists including tooltips etc.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo far it has been going quite well and I have the bulk of it working but I have hit a snag. The source spreadsheet I am working with has a number of cells that have restricted input which are in the form of drop-down lists. They all make reference to ranges of other cells that contain the items for the drop-down. But here is the snag: All the references are in the form of Names (e.g. AD_country_list) rather than the actual range. in Excel I can see what these lists contain by going to the Name Manager in the Formulas tab. I can get the names the drop-down cells are using via the getFormula1 call on the data validation object for the cell. But I am then stuck. I cannot find a way to look up the cells containing the list data from the name.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny ideas?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks\r<br />\n<br />\nMark.<br />\n",
