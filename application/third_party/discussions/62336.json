I believe this is an issue with OpenOffice.org 3.1 because when I created an .xlsx file in Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and tried to open it in OpenOffice.org 3.1 I found the same problem. (I tried to search for the problem in the bug tracker for OpenOffice.org, but gave up for now, it was sort of overwhelming... may look into this later)<br> <br> <em>&gt;&gt; Will this be implemented in the near future that DataValidation fields will operate<br> &gt;&gt; in OpenOffice, or is this something that doesn't exist on your to-do list ;-)</em><br> <br> I'm not 100% sure what this will require, but it has been documented for .xls, so I would guess it should be possible, but it may not come in the near future.
