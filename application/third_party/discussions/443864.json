When writing to CSV, PHPExcel will use that format mask to render the cell as a formatted date string. When MS Excel reads such a date string, it will convert it back to a float internally, and apply its default format mask, so you can get the format changing. You can try to change the Excel default mask (not sure how, but it's locale specific as well, or use the Excel import wizard which (IIRC) allows you to control how date columns are formatted... but otherwise MS Excel is kinda limited when reading CSV files. You can apply a new format mask to those columns in PHPExcel, but you can't control how MS Excel will reformat those dates subsequently when it's loading a CSV, only when it's loading an actual spreadsheet format (e.g. xls, xlsx).<br />\n",
