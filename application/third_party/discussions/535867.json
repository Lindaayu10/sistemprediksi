    "Html": "There is built in function to convert integers to cols (don't have code now, so I will not paste it here). It is quite easy to know how many row/cols you want to select. So I convert it to XX:88 using built in function and then I select style (or other stuff). Easy workaround.\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso what I would notice is that above code actually works, but not as we expect. Lets say you have 10 rows. You will set style to 1000 rows. Now we have some fun, because when you open your xslx file it will have all 1000 lines visible, not 10. It will be also x times heavier. So making A1:XFD1 (A) is just impossible because of memory consumption to handle this.\r<br />\nThere should be something like getStyle('A', TRUE) which would get all used A:? fields (TRUE flag for &quot;get available&quot;).<br />\n",
