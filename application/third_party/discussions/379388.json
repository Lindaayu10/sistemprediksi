Is there something tricky happening here? :)&nbsp; My first thoughts were that maybe they were validated against at some point so a negative might be needed for failure, but what I'm seeing is just simple use/incrementation.</p>\r\n<p>In all the code I've been exposed to thus far, it has been more common to instantiate to zero, and do a\r\n<em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">$x&#43;&#43;</span></em> type incrementation. What is the reason it's been done the way it has in this PHPExcel code?</p>\r\n<p>NOTE: I'm <em>hoping</em> for a more exotic answer than &quot;<em>personal style</em>&quot; so I can learn something new and exciting .. yet &quot;<em>personal style</em>&quot; is my current guess :)</p>\r\n",
