I have a document with 4 sheets. But&nbsp;I can´t read the last one. I don't know why. It is a sheet with a summary of the previous sheets.&nbsp;I have this code inside of a 'while' loop. The error message is:&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<table cellspacing=1 cellpadding=4 border=5>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <b>\r\n        <blockquote dir=ltr style=\"margin-right:0px\">\r\n        <p>Fatal error</b>: Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'Active sheet index is out of bounds.' in D:\\OCS Inventory NG\\xampp\\htdocs\\eP01\\PHPExcel.php:291 Stack trace: #0 D:\\OCS Inventory NG\\xampp\\htdocs\\eP01\\indexFRAN.php(51): PHPExcel-&gt;setActiveSheetIndex(3) #1 {main} thrown in <b>D:\\OCS Inventory NG\\xampp\\htdocs\\eP01\\PHPExcel.php</b> on line <b>291</b>\r\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n        <blockquote></blockquote></p>\r\n        </blockquote>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't understand why the active sheet is out of bound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to say that I work with files that have macro and diferent levels of permissions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n¿Can anyone help me?\r\n",
