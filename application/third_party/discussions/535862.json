I'm interested about good practices and to see how others are using the library. \r<br />\n<br />\nI'm a beginner even in OOP field, so I hope you will understand my question and motivation.\r<br />\n<br />\nCan you name some open source projects which are using PHPExcel library? I've tried to find some projects on github, but without any luck. Maybe I don't know how to search for a project which use a certain library.\r<br />\n<br />\nPlease give me your advice about how to search for open source project which use a certain library, PHPExcel in our case.\r<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks!<br />\n",
