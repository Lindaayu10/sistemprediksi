Most of them have formulas and validations in the cells causing the memory to be inflated and reading them in is slow. So I figured that I could serialize each of them and use them as templates that way. If I read them in with setReadDataOnly(true) would I be able to use the spreadsheet to write to it when I read in the phpxl file?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
