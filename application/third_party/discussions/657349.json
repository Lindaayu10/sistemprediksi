Is this correct? I've even tried creating a Slicer (and required, inserted table) within a template and used the template file to create my file with PHPExcel, but that just removes the Slicer because the file written out is first a php file then rewritten to be an Excel file. \r<br />\n<br />\nAre there any options to make this work?\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm on PHP 5.6 and Excel 2016. Latest version of PHP Excel as of this date.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!!<br />\n",
