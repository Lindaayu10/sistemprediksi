It has images in the excel and has no problem saving it on the server. However, when I try to do the following so that the user can save the file, the image doesn't work at all and so is the data. Is there any solution to this so that the file is prompt for the user to download instead of saving in the server?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>header('Content-Type: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet');</p>\r\n<p>header('Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=&quot;05featuredemo.xlsx&quot;');header('Cache-Control: max-age=0');</p>\r\n<p>$objWriter = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPExcel, 'Excel2007');</p>\r\n<p>$objWriter-&gt;save('php://output');</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
