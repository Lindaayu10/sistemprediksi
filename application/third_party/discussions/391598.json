I'm getting odd results.</p>\r\n<p>To simplify the testing, I created a spreadsheet in LibreOffice that has &quot;tom&quot;, &quot;dick&quot; and &quot;harry&quot; in A1:A3 and 5, 6, and 7 in B1:B3.&nbsp; I write it out as a .xlsx file.&nbsp; Then I run what is basically the test program 07reader.php - the only change\r\n is to get the file names from the command line.</p>\r\n<p>When I open the copied .xlsx file in LibreOffice, it does not complain about the file format.&nbsp; However, the row numbers are on the right, and the sheet names are at the right going left (perhaps switched to a right to left language?).&nbsp; The A, B,\r\n C ... column headings are missing and the cell area is all grey.</p>\r\n<p>If I use PHPExcel to create the file, the copy works perfectly, so I'm pretty sure the copy is OK.&nbsp; For the project I need to preserve formulas, etc., so I've not tried ReadDataOnly.</p>\r\n<p>I'm using PHPExcel v. 1.7.7, PHP v. 5.3.8, and LibreOffice 3.5.5.3.</p>\r\n<p>I've ordered Office 2010 to see if the same thing happens there, but I was hoping LibreOffice would work as well</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>-- bill</p>\r\n",
