    "Html": "<p>You're right: there are a lot of problems with the PDF Writer; and every attempt to fix one problem creates half a dozen more.</p>\r\n<p>PHPExcel uses the third-party tcPDF library, which is excessively bloated, eats memory, and doesn't produce a good display. Reverting the tcPDF library to an earlier version may resolve some problems, but cause others.</p>\r\n<p>For the future, I'm planning to remove the bundled tcPDF completely, and allow PHPExcel to be configured to use alternative libraries such as DomPDF or mPDF. I've posted some comments about that in <a href=\"http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/discussions/242617\">this thread</a>&nbsp;which mentions some of the pros and cons of each library, though I've not had much feedback as yet.</p>",
