Magic quotes was removed from PHP as of 5.4.x.  I'm in the process of upgrading my server's PHP version from 5.3 to at least 5.4, and I'm a bit concerned about this, but I haven't found any reference to the issue within the PHPExcel Discussions or Issues.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs anyone else concerned about this?  Should I not be?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\nJon<br />\n",
