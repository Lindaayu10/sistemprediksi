PHPexcel is an amazing and pretty useful library thanks for sharing. This is my only bug its a project for my dissertation but i am gonna run it on a shared hosting after hardening it a bit. Project went out really good.On a later stage i am gonna post&nbsp; a function i made to check the excel file for malicious code and would need some help cause this function renders a file that puts after checking it all the contents in the first column.Uses fgets the only one that works. I 've put some malicious code in the uploaded excel file it does no harm but i obviously aint gonna run the site live without checking the file prior the reading.</p>\r\n<p>With respect, to you and all</p>\r\n<p>George.</p>",
