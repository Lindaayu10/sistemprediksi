    "Html": "Hello. I need to create multiple column where the headers look something like this (please excuse the mad ASCII skillz):<br />\n<pre><code>_________________\n|_____header_____|\n|_sub 1__|__sub 2_|\n</code></pre>\n\nObviously, the “header” cell is two merged cells (e.g. C2:D2), while the “subs” are regular single cells. All three need to have centered text, so I’ve applied the PHPExcel_Style_Alignment to the whole range (e.g. C2:D3), and this works fine when the sheet is exported to XLS.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, when I render a PDF (with mPDF), the centred style only gets applied to the unmerged “sub” cells, while the merged “header” cell gets the default left-alignment style. I tried applying the style for this cell individually, before and after the merge, none of that seemed to affect anything.<br />\n<br />\nOnce again, the issue only occurs in the generated PDF, the XLS is fine.<br />\n<br />\nAny idea on how to resolve this?<br />\n",
