Awesome stuff.<br />\n<br />\nHopefully this is an easy one for someone.  I can pull my excel file in and display it as a table and I know I can save that table to mySQL as I have done this in the past without PHPExcel. Where I am stuck is cleaning the import. <br />\n<br />\nSo I guess the question is:<br />\n<br />\nIf you take for example I do not want to import any column that does not have a H column value. Can I filter the table on import or must I fix on export?<br />\n<br />\nIf I can on import that would really cut down on overhead as the sheet is rather large and I can eliminate a lot of comments cells and just grab the data I need.<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance,<br />\n<br />\nBrett C.<br />\n",
