At least, that's been my experience. I've tried creating independent PHPExcel_Worksheet objects, but kept running into errors with formatters, etc, with undefined object ($this-&gt;getParent()-&gt;blah()).</p>\r\n<p>My dilemma:</p>\r\n<p>I have a list of about 50 or so users, with commission info. I'm generating a document, for each user, with their detailed info. The issue: some of these users are managers, and their document is to include people under them. An excel document is taking\r\n a good ~2 seconds *per person* to create. I'm trying to find a way to optimize this the best way I can. I'm looking for a way to create a document off cached, or previously generated, excel worksheets. But, I'm running into trouble. A worksheet is tied to\r\n a specifical PHPExcel parent, even though PHPExcel has an addSheet() option. There isn't any setParent() option in PHPExcel_Worksheet. I've tried overloading, and adding my own, but that actually didn't work too well, either.</p>\r\n<p>I need some way to cache generated Excel Worksheets. Is there any way to do this?</p>\r\n<p>I've tried all sorts of ways: saving $activeSheet to an array, saving it to a Zend_Cache repository, overloading PHPExcel_Worksheet to add setParent(). Nothing's working.</p>\r\n",
