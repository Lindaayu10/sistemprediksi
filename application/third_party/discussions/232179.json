    "Html": "PHPExcel uses tcPDF for generating PDF output from HTML, If you can <br />confirm that PHPExcel generates HTML output showing the correct <br />characters, then the problem is that tcPDF doesn't include MS Mincho.<br />I know that arialunicid0-japanese is included in the font distribution <br />with tcPDF, so you could always use that instead. Alternatively (I can't <br />read Japanese, so I can't say for certain) the following link seems to <br />describe how to add MS Mincho to tcPDF.<br /><br />http://labs.mythos-jp.com/blog/archives/241<br /><br />---<br />Mark Baker",

    "Html": "\r\n<p>well,</p>\r\n<p>I have solved the problem. Even though the way i solved is very rough. Need to work more to get a proper solution.</p>\r\n<p>To do so, I have followed the instruction given in</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><strong>http://labs.mythos-jp.com/blog/archives/241</strong></span></span></p>\r\n<p>this link. This link is completely in Japanese. Trust me I dont understand Japanese either. I used google translator to understand it.</p>\r\n<p>To do so, you will need several things.</p>\r\n<p>1. The full font. Download it from internet(I googled MS Mincho. its size was 7.8 MB or something close)</p>\r\n<p>2. download TCPDF.&nbsp; You may ask &quot;<strong>why? its already with PHPExcel.</strong>&quot;. Yes it is true. But that portion dont have all the tools. It only have required tools that it needed.</p>\r\n<p>3. Now follow the instruction listed in <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">\r\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><strong>http://labs.mythos-jp.com/blog/archives/241.</strong></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though all is described very will, I will give a little discription</span></span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i)&nbsp;&nbsp; extract the TCPDF\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii)&nbsp; move the dowloaded ttf file to\r\n<strong>TCPDF/fonts/utils/</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directory<br>\r\n</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii)\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">open command promt go to TCPDF directory. in my case it was C Drive root directory(I used it in windows)</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv) change your directory to\r\n</span></span><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>TCPDF/fonts/utils/.\r\n</strong></span><strong></strong></span><code style=\"color:#ffffff!important\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">In my case C:/tcpdf/fonts/utils. (sorry later I found the tools are available :) )IN</span><span style=\"color:#000000\">\r\n</span></code></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style=\"color:#000000\">\r\nthe directory you will get <strong>ttf2ufm.exe</strong></span> for windows and <strong>\r\nttf2ufm</strong>(I guess for linux)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now from command prompt use the command below: The font file name was ms-mincho.ttf</p>\r\n<p><code style=\"color:#ffffff!important\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;ttf2ufm.exe -a -F\r\n<strong>ms-mincho.ttf</strong></span></code></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three file will be generated(in my case i got lots of warnings. I dont know what to do with that). But Its working. so I ignored it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is a php file in the current directory name\r\n</span><strong>makefont.php</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now do the command below</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&gt;[complete path of PHP]\\php.exe ms-mincho.ttf ms-mincho.ufm 0</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in my case the path is <strong>C:\\Program Files\\EasyPHP-5.3.3\\php</strong>\\<strong>php.exe</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It created a file name <strong>ms-mincho.php</strong> in the same directory. now you have four file name with\r\n<strong>ms-mincho</strong> without(ms-mincho.ttf)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Move all the file to <strong>[ the installtion directory of PHPExcel ]/Classes/Shared/PDF/fonts/</strong> directory. in my case\r\n<strong>C:\\Program Files\\EasyPHP-5.3.3\\php\\1.7.4\\PHPExcel\\Shared\\PDF\\fonts</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in my system I have moved out PHPExcel directory from Classes. So dont get confused.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, Your font is ready to use.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">&nbsp;&nbsp; PHPExcel is not well defined yet to use font or may I just dont know how to do it. But I have found my own way with my limited knowledge and intelligence.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open </span><strong>PHPExcel\\Writer\\PDF.php</strong> with some suitable php editor. Find the line\r\n<strong>$pdf-&gt;SetFont($this-&gt;_font)</strong> if you print this line for test purpose you will see that the value is showing\r\n<strong>freesans</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; To fix my problem. I did deal with the whole thing. I just change only\r\n<strong>$pdf-&gt;SetFont($this-&gt;_font) </strong>to <strong>$pdf-&gt;SetFont('ms-mincho').\r\n</strong>It solved my problem. Now I can see the proper japanese in my PDF file.</p>\r\n<p>I did this because I need both xls and pdf file on some certain format so I needed this.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">If you have better solution please let me know.</span></strong></p>\r\n",
