And that limit is 230 rows.</b><br>\r\nWhen trying to insert 231 rows, the file becomes corrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso a strange thing is, it is working perfect when generating XLSx or CSV. <br>\r\nIs this somehow fix-able?\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nBest regards,\r\nTim\r\n<br><br>\r\nps: I am using the latest version",

I will look into the documentation you mentioned.<br>\r\nBest regards,<br>\r\nTim",
