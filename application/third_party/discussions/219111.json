Best Regards, zenixgrace</blockquote>\r\n<p>However much you increase the memory availability, you will always find a spreadsheet that exceeds it. The best way to solve the problem is to use caching, which will limit the size of the spreadsheet to the maximum cache size, and this should always be much larger than the memory allocation. However, in my experience the caching does not work. Is this a bug? I tried cache_to_discISAM, cache_to_phpTemp, and cache_to_memcache. When initialsing them, the calls all&nbsp;returned TRUE, indicating they had been initialised correctly. In all cases I still got the dreaded &quot;<strong>Fatal error</strong>: Allowed memory size of 67108864 bytes exhausted...'.</p>\r\n<p>Has anyone got any experience of using the caching successfully? Any help would be very&nbsp;greatfully received!</p>\r\n<p>Best regards</p>\r\n<p>Si</p>",

With cell cacheing (such as php://temp or DiskISAM), that can be reduced to about a third, so the 8000 lines by 31 columns will require about 80MB.

It puts the whole memory&nbsp;issue into context. The spreadsheet I was trying to open easily exceeds the memory capabilities of the server, even when using caching. There is a huge data set contained within this spreadsheet,&nbsp;which could never be held in memory where each cell takes 1K of storage. I extracted the data and wrote it into a MySQL table which got around the problem. I am using PHPExcel in cases where the spreadsheets do not contain so much data and it works exceedingly well. I greatly appreciate your efforts in developing and maintaining&nbsp;such a valuable tool.</p>\r\n<p>Best regards</p>\r\n<p>Si</p>",
