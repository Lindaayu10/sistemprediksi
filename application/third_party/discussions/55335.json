I need to get some formatting done in a few cells and have tried different characters to create a linefeed (&quot;\\n&quot;, &quot;\\r\\n&quot;, &quot;\\r&quot;). I am using the Excel5 output.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpenOffice.org 2.4 handles this very well with every instance of the linefeed character. Excel (different versions 2003 - 2007) does not. It displays a small cube instead of a linefeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have tried to enable richt text in the cell markup, but that doesn't help. I have been unable to find this particular issue in the documentation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan anybody shed some light on this issue?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks a lot... Nico<br>\r\n",
