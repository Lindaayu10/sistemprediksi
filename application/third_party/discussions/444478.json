    "Html": "So the biggest problem I am facing is when doing inserting a cell value or an array, I have to give it a coordinate, e.g. A5. Is there a way to have each time I insert something into a set of cells, the next one I enter automatically adds below. \r<br />\n<br />\nLet's say I have an array I build by pulling data off a database table. It ends up with 30 rows. I add it to the sheet. Now Another array gets built the same way. I will want it to be added right after the first array. Without having to know the cell number, because the arrays will always be changing in size. Hope that makes sense :)<br />\n",
