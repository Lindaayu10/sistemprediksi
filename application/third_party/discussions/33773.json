On my development server (Windows Vista - Apache 2.2.9 - PHP 5.2.6) I get exactly what I expect collecting data from a MYSql database and writing it to an Excel workbook with multiple worksheets using PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5. I have inserted graphs of the data as PHPExcel_Worksheet_Drawings using the jpGraph library. It all works beautifully, my client is very impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's the big <strong>BUT</strong>: When I run the code on the production server (Linux - Apache 2.0 - PHP 5.2.1) the workbook is produced with all the worksheets, the graphs are there with the correct data, the cells are all formated as they should be but there is no data?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny ideas on what I have done wrong?<br>\r\n",

I did some testing and found the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting <code>error_reporting(E_ALL)</code> reveals the problem when one uses the Excel5 writer:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<code><strong>Notice</strong>: iconv() [function.iconv]: Wrong charset, conversion from `UTF-8' to `Windows-1252' is not allowed in <strong>/home/lo/log/logss.com.au/public/www/koyama/PHPExcel/Classes/PHPExcel/Writer/Excel5.php</strong> on line <strong>166</strong><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Notice</strong>: iconv() [function.iconv]: Wrong charset, conversion from `UTF-8' to `UTF-16LE' is not allowed in <strong>/home/lo/log/logss.com.au/public/www/koyama/PHPExcel/Classes/PHPExcel/Writer/Excel5/Worksheet.php</strong> on line <strong>1608</strong><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</code>\r\nPointing to these lines respectively:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<code>'NumFormat' =&gt; iconv(&quot;UTF-8&quot;, &quot;Windows-1252&quot;, $style-&gt;getNumberFormat()-&gt;getFormatCode()),<br>\r\n<br>\r\n$str = iconv($this-&gt;_input_encoding, 'UTF-16LE', $str);<br>\r\n</code><br>\r\nApparently, the iconv function is broken on your platform. Some (most?) conversions are not working such as converting 'UTF-8' to 'UTF-16LE'. <code>iconv()</code> simply returns <code>bool(false)</code> in those cases. That is why you get blank cells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seems to be a known issue:<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=44096\">http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=44096</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>\r\nSolution:</strong><br>\r\nYou may try using <code>mb_convert_encoding()</code> instead of <code>iconv()</code>. I tried on your server and it worked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<code>\r\n//'NumFormat' =&gt; iconv(&quot;UTF-8&quot;, &quot;Windows-1252&quot;, $style-&gt;getNumberFormat()-&gt;getFormatCode()),<br>\r\n'NumFormat' =&gt; mb_convert_encoding($style-&gt;getNumberFormat()-&gt;getFormatCode(), &quot;Windows-1252&quot;, &quot;UTF-8&quot;),<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n//$str = iconv($this-&gt;_input_encoding, 'UTF-16LE', $str);<br>\r\n$str = mb_convert_encoding($str, 'UTF-16LE', $this-&gt;_input_encoding);<br>\r\n</code>\r\n<br>\r\nI have no idea if this is this PHP issue is a common problem or not. If someone knows if the PHPExcel source needs to be modified please post. Maarten, any opinion on this?\r\n",
