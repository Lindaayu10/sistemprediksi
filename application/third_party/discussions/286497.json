In some php files I would like to include_once one template of the &quot;tests&quot; directory so I can use variables to an excel file. Can I do that\r\n and still use for my code the GPLv3 also mentioning that phpexcel is distributed under the LGPL?</p>\r\n<p>Or am I breaking the terms of the lisence by that? Thanx in advance and I am sorry if the question seems a bit silly to u.</p>\r\n<p>PS:Great software.Keep up the good work.</p>\r\n",

My english isn't that good enough to know for sure that's why I am asking.Sorry for that.</p>\r\n<p>Offcourse I will include the lgpl and say that phpexcel is under this lisence. In simple words. I copied the phpexcel folder, PHPExcel.php, 03formulas.php into my apllication dir. Edited 03formulas.php. Added a comment in 03formulas.php that says that I edited this file and this file only including the timestamp.</p>\r\n<p>In my application footer I stated that my software is under GPLv3 lisence but it uses PHPExcel which is under the LGPL Lisence.</p>\r\n<p>My question is.&nbsp; Should I release my whole code with&nbsp; LGPL because the file 03formulas.php is included in one of my files? Or can I stay with GPLv3 for my files and my files only as I say above?</p>\r\n<p>Sorry for all the trouble. I just want to be sure before I release.</p>",
