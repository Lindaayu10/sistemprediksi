    "Html": "\r\n<p>I have a site where users can upload Excel 2007 spreadsheets containing data which is extracted and processed overnight. Occasionally users will upload a password-protected file by accident. I'm aware that PHPExcel can't open files where the whole document\r\n is password protected (i.e. the file cannot be opened without entering the password), and I can work around that restriction. However, is there a way that I can tell if a given file is password protected before trying to load the file for processing? At the\r\n moment the initial loading code looks like this:</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>$objReader = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> PHPExcel_Reader_Excel2007();\r\n$objReader-&gt;setReadDataOnly(true);\r\n$objPHPExcel = $objReader-&gt;load($<span style=\"color:blue\">file</span>[<span style=\"color:#a31515\">'file_path'</span>]);\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\nIf the file is password protected, PHP prints lots of warnings before finally bailing out with a fatal error. Ideally I'd like to call a function before loading the file (e.g. isPasswordProtected($file_path)) or catch an exception.\r\n<p></p>\r\n",
