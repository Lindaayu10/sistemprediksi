I have mysql DB if needed. I just don’t know how to use PHPExcel I’ve looked at some test files and when I click on one it say open or save I click open and it opens into excel on my PC. I don’t want to use excel locally because the people that will be using the file I create don’t have excel and would not understand it anyway so If it was on the website they would enter data certain thing would be calculated automatically with formulas like excel on save all the data would be saved then when the file was pulled up again all data and calculations would appear as they enter it.. The world could enter data and it would do the calculations and save it. Once the PHP file is up and running to that point I will use PHP to make a viewable only file to the world and a logon for those that are admin and can edit or enter data.</p>\r\n",

Basically I put in a name the place they finished in the race and some other race stats. The speed sheet figures there score and ranks each driver according to their score. I would like to make it a php script /app so it could be on the web and others could fill in data and it calculate just as if it were excel. I want to get completely away from having to use excel it would be a web app type deal. I wouldn’t care if others used it for their races; basically an open source project is fine. I know in my area it would get used, but not get improved upon so collaboration would be users / programming enthusiast I guess</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "I think I would probably go another route if I were you.&nbsp; In my view you have a few options.&nbsp; 1. Use MySQL and PHP to create a form/database/view concept to accomplish this.&nbsp; You can use formulas (depending on their complexity) in your database.&nbsp; 2. Use Google Docs.&nbsp; If memory serves they have an API that enables you to &quot;hide&quot; the underlying engine with forms and some display page for the results.&nbsp; 3. Use an online database provider like <a href=\"http://dabbledb.com/\">DabbleDB</a> or <a href=\"http://www.zoho.com/\">Zoho</a>.&nbsp; They are fast, easy to use and wil enable you to get up and running quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that writing and re-writing an Excel file is probably overkill for what you are trying to accomplish.<br>\r\n",
