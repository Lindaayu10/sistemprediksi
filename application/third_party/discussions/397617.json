The file would open, the default printing option (print active worksheets) would be\r\n fine (since all sheets are selected) and so the whole file would be printed. Otherwise - if there is only one sheet selected - only one sheet is being printed.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to print a lot of xls files with more then one sheet inside - and if you don't want to open each file manually and select all sheets or set the printing option to 'print all sheets - it seems this is the only one way to accomplish this. Windows\r\n allows you to select&nbsp;(and print)&nbsp;up to 15 files via context menu.</p>\r\n<p>Is there a chance that this feature will be implemented? This would be really great! I wrote a&nbsp;little tool for a school and the secretaries love it, but it is a lot of work to open&nbsp;over 40 excel files (for each class)&nbsp;each time and do the\r\n things described above in order to print them out.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for any reply!</p>\r\n<p>P.S. I guess, that is what he meant, too: <a href=\"http://phpexcel.codeplex.com/discussions/355844\">\r\nhttp://phpexcel.codeplex.com/discussions/355844</a></p>\r\n<p>P.P.S. <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"color:black; font-size:10pt\">Another, easier way would of course be to save the printing option (print all sheets) by default &ndash; but I guess this is not possible, since even Excel itself does not allow you to save this.</span></p>\r\n",
