    "Html": "Hi There,<br />\n<br />\nI'm currently trying to use your library to read an Excel document, but am encountering issues (created by myself, i might add, this is not a bug report). I have referenced the what i have gathered are the correct files for this purpose (IOFactory.php) and have tried to use the following:<br />\n<br />\n<strong>require_once 'C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\Web App\\PHPExcel\\classes\\phpexcel\\IOFactory.php';</strong><br />\n<strong>$objPHPExcel = PHPExcel_IOFactory::load(&quot;example report.xlsx&quot;);</strong><br />\n<strong>echo &quot;$objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getCell('K12')&quot;;</strong><br />\n<br />\n[ i'm aware my echo'ing is wrong, i'll fix that after this issue :) ]<br />\n<br />\nHowever i cant seem to get this to work, i get the following message:<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Notice: Undefined property: PHPExcel::$getActiveSheet in C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\Web App\\Fospha Score Gen.php on line 33<br />\n()-&gt;getCell('K12')</strong><br />\n<br />\nSome help and pointers would be appreciated on where im going wrong/ what i should be doing. I got most of what i have done here from reading ' <a href=\"http://blog.mayflower.de/561-Import-and-export-data-using-PHPExcel.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.mayflower.de/561-Import-and-export-data-using-PHPExcel.html</a> '<br />\n<br />\nI've used this as i'm a newb to coding etc, but have decided to dive right in, so this would be a helpful learning experience too.<br />\n<br />\nMany Thanks,<br />\n<br />\nStephen<br />\n",
