However, as soon as&nbsp; modify this file, it stop working (I mean I still can download the file but Excel do not\r\n regognize it. I tried with 2 different versions of MS Excel). When I modify the file, I save it in UTF-8 format (using Windows Notepad) since the file seams already in UTF-8 format.</p>\r\n<p>If I save the file in ANSI format, it will start back to work except that I do not see miscellaneous glyphs characters ('&eacute;&agrave;&egrave;&ugrave;&acirc;&ecirc;&icirc;&ocirc;&ucirc;&euml;&iuml;&uuml;&yuml;&auml;&ouml;&uuml;&ccedil;') anymore in the\r\n output Excel file.</p>\r\n<p>Is somebody could help me since I need to export UTF-8 characters to an Excel5 XLS file and for the moment, nothing seams to work... :-(</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance anyway.</p>\r\n<p>Guylain Plante</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Using output\r\n buffering is preventing this output from occuring before the headers, so there won't be any error, but the BOM marker itself will still be included in the Excel file that is generated.</p>\r\n",

Here is the beginning of the file:</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\">EF BB BF EF BB BFEF BB BFEF BB BFEF BB BFEF BB BF</span> D0 CF 11</p>\r\n<p>After I removed the red part using an Hex File Editor, my excel fine worked just fine. So, I hope that saving my php file without BOM will correct the problem. I will let you know.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks again.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
