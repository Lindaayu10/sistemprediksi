    "Html": "Hi All,\r<br />\n<br />\nThis came up first in my search results and didn't help with my issue which was the same as the one in the first post. I thought I'd post how I got it working for me in case it helps someone else with the same issue.\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm using phpExcel on a WIMP setup and I was trying to read and write to an Excel 2007 file. All the test scripts worked fine for me but whenever I tried to test my own script it would always return the error in the first post. The difference was in my script I was using a file upload dialogue to upload my excel file. It seems that on Windows phpExcel didn't like the temp file name (something.tmp). Here's a snippet of the original code that works fine on a proper *nix server but not on Windows:<br />\n<pre><code>    $extension = pathinfo($_FILES['file']['name'], PATHINFO_EXTENSION);\n    $upload_file = $_FILES['file']['tmp_name']; \n    $objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReaderForFile($upload_file);\n\n    if($extension=='xls') {\n        $objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel5');\n    }\n    else {\n        $objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel2007');\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\nTo get it to work on a Windows server I had to move the temp file to the original file name:<br />\n<pre><code>    $extension = pathinfo($_FILES['file']['name'], PATHINFO_EXTENSION);\n    $upload_file = $_FILES['file']['tmp_name']; \n\n    //here's the bit I added \n    move_uploaded_file($upload_file, realpath('./tmp/') . &quot;\\\\&quot; . $_FILES['file']['name']);\n    $upload_file = realpath('./tmp/') . &quot;\\\\&quot; . $_FILES['file']['name'];\n\n    $objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReaderForFile($upload_file);\n    if($extension=='xls') {\n        $objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel5');\n    }\n    else {\n        $objReader = PHPExcel_IOFactory::createReader('Excel2007');\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\nI haven't looked into why this fixes the problem. I'm just happy that it does and I can resume testing on my dev server. I hope this help someone else as it took me a long time to figure this one out.<br />\n",
