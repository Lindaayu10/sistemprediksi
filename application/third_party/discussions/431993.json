I know it's completely down to me doing something wrong but not sure what.\r<br />\n<br />\nOriginall was receiving the error &quot;PDF Rendering library has not been defined&quot;. After reading a thread in PDF.php added:<br />\n<pre><code>    //$rendererName = PHPExcel_Settings::PDF_RENDERER_MPDF;\n    $rendererName = PHPExcel_Settings::PDF_RENDERER_DOMPDF;\n    //$rendererLibrary = 'tcPDF5.9';\n    //$rendererLibrary = 'mPDF5.4';\n    $rendererLibrary = '../libraries/PDF/';\n\n    if (!PHPExcel_Settings::setPdfRenderer($rendererName,$rendererLibrary)) {\n    die('NOTICE: Please set the $rendererName and $rendererLibraryPath values at the top of this script as appropriate for your directory structure');\n    }   \n</code></pre>\n\nThis has stopped that error however the PDF doc are not being created correctly. They won't open as they report its either not a supported file type or because the file is damaged.\r<br />\n<br />\nAm I adding the above code in the wrong location?\r<br />\n<br />\nThe domPDF libraries are under phpexcel in /libraries/PDF.\r<br />\n<br />\nMany thanks.<br />\n",
