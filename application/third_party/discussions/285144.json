The documentation says that PHPExcel creates an in-memory spreadsheet,\r\n so it seems there should be a way to use a PHP script to grab that data and insert it into a database table. Is there anything already developed that can do that? Or can someone point me to how I could access the in-memory spreadsheet with PHP?</p>\r\n",
