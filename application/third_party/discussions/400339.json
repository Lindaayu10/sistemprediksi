I'm asuming that it's your template; but it complains about the protection when I load it in MS Excel 2010. PHPExcel has a similar problem reading the protection, and writes\r\n the workbook with an empty password which gives validation errors when tested under the OpenXML SDK Productivity Tool, related to the protected ranges.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Looking at your template: MS Excel itself displays the message: &quot;The data range is too complex to be displayed&quot; when I try to display the data source, and I thought at first that it was probably a bit too complex for PHPExcel to handle; but subsequent investigation\r\n has revealed only a few discrepancies.</p>\r\n<p>I've modified the chart writer code to handle references to cells where data isn't pre-populated, and made a minor tweak to the order in which XML elements are written: I'll upload these fixes to github later tonight.</p>\r\n",
