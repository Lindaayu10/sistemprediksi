Assuming you're using 32-bit PHP, then 30,000 rows and 18 columns equates to 540,000 cells or 530MB. The Writer doubles that requirement, so about 1.6GB. That's without factoring in any memory for the library itself (about 20MB) and your own script and variables.</p>\r\n<p>Caching methods reduce the cell memory requirement, but don't eliminate it.</p>",
