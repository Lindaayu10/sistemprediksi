    "Html": "Hey all, I am trying to write an export that takes data from mysql and puts it into excel.\r\n\r\nWhen doing so with just a few rows it works great, but my database has up to 13000 rows. Running the script on that runs out of memory.\r\n\r\nI was wondering what a good way to avoid this is. I tried to use the new caching functions, but to be honest, I am not sure how to do so. Is there any examples of it being used?\r\n\r\nDo I simply add the lines\r\n\r\n$cacheMethod = PHPExcel_CachedObjectStorageFactory::cache_to_discISAM;\r\nPHPExcel_Settings::setCacheStorageMethod($cacheMethod);\r\n\r\nto my code before I create my PHPExcel object?\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks a ton.",

How is that possible? Why is it causing me to use MORE memory.\r\n\r\nMy simple output of 13000 rows of 1 column takes roughly 60MB with no caching, and it takes like 62-65 with, thats all very bizarre to me.\r\n\r\nAny idea what is happening?",

The changes that I have made reduce the problem without completely eliminating the issue. A script that uses the cell caching should now use less memory than the equivalent script against the 1.7.2 release, whichever writer is being used, but eliminating the memory leaks completely will be an ongoing process.</p>",
