    "Html": "(Using PHPExcel 1.6.2)<br>\r\nI had the same problem and succeeded to resolve it.<br>\r\nSuch like you valerio, i tried to define a temp directory to store a temporary file but it failed with Linux. Why ? It seems that the only that this temporary file is created is with the only readable right just for the root guy, even in the /tmp folder (witch is open in RW for everyone).<br>\r\nI have done that like that :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n$objWriter = new PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5($objPHPExcel);\r\n<br>\r\n$objWriter-&gt;setTempDir(&quot;/var/www/tmp&quot;); <em>//This never worked i don't know why... it still working on the /tmp directory</em><br>\r\n//To store on a local folder<br>\r\n$objWriter-&gt;save($nomficXLS);\r\n<br>\r\n$fp = fopen($nomficXLS, 'rb');\r\n<br>\r\nsleep(1);&nbsp;\r\n//just a pause to let him time but i am not sure now if this is needed<br>\r\nfpassthru($fp);\r\n<br>\r\nfclose($fp);&nbsp;\r\n//to close the file<br>\r\nunlink($nomficXLS);\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe previews method never worked for me because of the read only property given for the root<br>\r\nSo I have changed and decided to not work with a temporary file, like that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n$objWriter = new PHPExcel_Writer_Excel5($objPHPExcel);\r\n<br>\r\n//sending the file with the data directly<br>\r\n$objWriter-&gt;save('php://output');\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it works now... I mean I receave the file and can watch everything fine. The only thing that do not work properly is the cells calculation formated like '=SUM(A4:A100)'. I don't know why, even if i specified : $objPHPExcel-&gt;getActiveSheet()-&gt;getCell('A3')-&gt;getCalculatedValue();<br>\r\nIt doesn't worked. The cell is not calculated. If somebody has a clue... thanx to help :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
