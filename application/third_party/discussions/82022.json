It is available by link like <em>http://somedoma.in/test.php?arg1=val1&amp;arg2=val2&amp;arg3=val3</em></p>\r\n<p>Is there any ways to include such images in project?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I can access this script directly from the filesystem. I tried to pass arguments like <em>$objDrawing-&gt;setPath(&quot;test.php arg1=val1 arg2=val2 arg3=val3&quot;);</em> but it looks like <em>&quot;test.php arg1=val1 arg2=val2 arg3=val3&quot;</em> is a filename, not file with arguments.</p>\r\n<p>Well, I can fetch it by <em>file_get_contents()</em> or something else, save the file, add to the project and delete it. I can rather add timestamp and/or random value to avoid file name collisions. but... I think this isn't a good idea at all.</p>\r\n<p>Probably it would be better to add images stream (that are got by <em>file_get_contents()</em>) directly to the project avoiding saving files. But I didn't find any methods like that.</p>",

Adding a generated image to an Excel worksheet (<em>http://somedoma.in/test.php?arg1=val1&amp;arg2=val2&amp;arg3=val3</em>)<br /><br />Did you use either of the two workarounds you mentioned?<br /><br />I had a look at the May 2009 workitem but it currently has a \"Proposed\" status so it looks like it will be a while before a permanent solution appears.<br /><br />With koyama's comment of the image not being part of the in-memory representation i would imagine only your first suggestion of creating a temporary file, adding it to the workbook and then deleting it after the workbook was generated would be possible.</p>",

Then it  would know not to attempt to find the file and attach it but rather just  create the entry with the TargetMode=\"External\" parameter.<br />This is all new to me but hopefully this is a valid suggestion. :)</p>",
