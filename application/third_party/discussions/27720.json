The file saved in Excel2007 format was really good, with all the formatting and pictures embedded in the file, but when I opened the Excel5 format, pictures are not shown or embedded. Even tried your sample php scripts and I got same results, can you help me about this problem? I used OpenOffice 2.4 opening the files, is the problem related to this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards \r\n",
