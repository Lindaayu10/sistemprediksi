Maybe a fix need to be implemented here, but a call to setRightToLeft(false) is solving the issue of column name on the right side;<br />\n<br />\nSecond think<br />\nWhen you select every cells of the sheet, then go to format =&gt; cell =&gt; width, check the 'Optimal Width' box and then apply, columns are right. Do the same for rows and you will get the right render.<br />\n<br />\nSorry for my poor english level, that's not my native language!<br />\n",
