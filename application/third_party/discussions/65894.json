I get a height like 68% and a width like 79% in Excel (or 61% &amp; 70% or 62% &amp; 71%).<br>Resizing: Resizing of an image is not possible if the original image is smaller than the size in setHeight, setWidth or setWidthAndHeight. The height will be extremely scaled.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Vertical Positioning</strong><br>Goal: Image at the footer of a Sheet.<br>Problem: Excel5Writer can&rsquo;t process images in header/footer</p>\r\n<p>Test 1:<br>Image in A1 + setOffsetY<br>Result: The vertical offset command has no effect at all.</p>\r\n<p>Test 2:<br>Large mostly transparent image in A1<br>Result: Visible image. But it&rsquo;s height differs through different worksheets because (??) of different row heights (different content with text wrap) used between A1 and the bottom of the image.<br>Are images attached to more cells than the one they&rsquo;re binded (setCoordinates) to?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>Fritz</p>",
