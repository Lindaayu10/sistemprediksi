Is it possible to take those 5 CSV files and create one xls document with 5 sheets (one csv per sheet)?\r<br />\n<br />\nThe CSV files are large (~5000 rows, 10 cols) and I want to know if it's possible to take CSV data and put it into a workbook sheet without looping through the CSV and writing one line at a time. (trying to avoid large memory usage).\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance<br />\n",
