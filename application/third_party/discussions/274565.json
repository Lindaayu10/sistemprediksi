But, when I try to set height and width using setHeight(), setWidth() or setHeightAndWidth I have same problem.<br>\r\nThe image size doesn't fit with the input, for example, I set the image size like below:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">$objDrawing-&gt;setWidthAndHeight(106,1000);</p>\r\n<p>When I look image size in Excel file, width of this image is set like the input, but for height, it's corresponding with the width. When I check the scale of this image, I see that &quot;Lock aspect ratio&quot; is checked. I think it's the problem that the image size\r\n doesn't fit with the input.<br>\r\nCan anybody tell me how to disable this Lock Aspect Ratio,.?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,.</p>\r\n",
