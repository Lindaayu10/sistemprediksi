But where can I find the &quot;general question&quot; part/menu item? Ooh I believe that I see it, is it the 'User Forum'?</p>\r\n<p>I have download the 1.7.6, the 1.7.6 with documentation and the PEAR...</p>\r\n<p>I'm using XAMMP and I have a Linux hosting provider. But how do I implement the library? Where can I find this documentation. I think I have to copy it somewhere in the PHP/PEAR directory but I'm not shure.</p>\r\n<p>I'm reading the documentation and I see the there for example: &quot;See Examples/Reader/exampleReader16.php for a working example of this code.&quot;\r\n<strong>But where can I find these examples</strong>, so that I can see how it works? Or do I not looking good?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Then my real question is:</strong></p>\r\n<p>I webmaster of a volleybal club. The member registration is done in excel. I'm writing now a login-, uploading-, and downloading script. I want also that if somebody uploads the member excel file, he can press on button &quot;update site&quot; then the excel file\r\n must converted to csv and then I have a php mysql script which filling the table members.</p>\r\n<p>Question is: Is it posible without opening the xls member file&nbsp; to this to a&nbsp; member .csv file? Or if I want to have it in csv then I to read the cell content so as written in the documentation, write this in memory or to a csv file, and then run\r\n my MySQL script?</p>\r\n<p>I hope that someone can help me</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\r\n<p>Nico</p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n",

As for your site, I seems unlogical to convert an excel spreadsheet to a csv file and then import that. i would rather just read the xls file, and write the values straight to the database.</p>",
