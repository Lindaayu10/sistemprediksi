However, this is not the default format for MS Excel 2003, it still uses BIFF\r\n version 8 as its default format, so we use the Excel5 Reader/Writer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf we were to provide separate writers for every single version of MS Excel, we'd have a lot of duplicate code that we'd need to maintain and keep synchronised, with no real benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reasons why we <b>call </b>the readers/writers Excel5 and Excel2007 is historic. Excel5 refers to version 5 of the BIFF format used for xls files (version 5 was introduced in MS Excel 95), while Excel2007 refers to the version of MS Excel when Microsoft\r\n introduced the new Office Open XML file format that is used for xlsx files. Changing those to something more meaningful (such as ExcelXLS and ExcelXLSX) would break backward compatibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nMark Baker<br>\r\n",
