The actual report's data is inaccurate using this design and not practical.MySQL doesn't group data like this and I have tried using PHP arrays etc and all control structure possible.<br />\n<br />\nAny advice would be appreciated.<br />\n",

    "Html": "Thank you for your reply. I thought as much and that is my concern. I have tried various loops to be able accurately get it to work but it's total disaster when matching results to users.<br />\n<br />\nThe above works with accurate data when the lessons are actual rows under 1 column header which then aligns with matching the correct learner.<br />\n<br />\nSeems like the above is not going to happen accurately? Design wise yes, without any consideration for the data... not a good idea.<br />\n",
