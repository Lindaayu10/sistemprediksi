The excel spreadsheet downloads to the users desktop. At times, depending on the users request for the spreadsheet, this can take a long time. I would like to post an image to tell them to please wait, and then remove the image\r\n after the spreadsheet has been created.</p>\r\n<p>What I cannot figure out is how, in javascript, to detect when the spreadsheet has been created.</p>\r\n<p>I have tried using an ajax routine, instead of windows.location.href,&nbsp;but I think the internal code of the spreadsheet is returned as the response, and the spreadsheet is not downloaded.</p>\r\n<p>It is necessary to have the spreadsheet downloaded (user reasons), rather than have it created in some server location and then accessed. Any ideas as to how to detect when the spreadsheet is available for download, so that I can then remove the &quot;please\r\n wait&quot; image in javascript?</p>\r\n<p>FYI, as you can probably guess, I am relatively new to this programming environment (javascript,php).</p>\r\n",
